<h2>Automatic Pointer Calibration with Dasher</h2>
<p>
Imagine that a user's pointing device requires continuous
 calibration. For example, most eyetrackers have parameters
 that need adjusting as the user wriggles around.
</p>
<p>
 If the user is using Dasher, then the history of <em>alleged</em>
 pointing directions contains rich information that
 can be used to calibrate the information-conveying dimension
 of the screen (usually the y-dimension, in Dasher).
</p>
<p>
 The idea is simple.
 Imagine that there is a slight vertical miscalibration.
 As the user uses Dasher for a short duration, he will be able, in spite of the
 miscalibration, to arrive at his destination (because the  closer
 the user gets to one target  the "Dasher library shelf", the smaller the  calibration
 error is relative to the size of the target).  
 Assume that at time 1 the user is indeed looking at a target, which is small
 and to the right-hand side; and
 that at time 2 the user has reached the target.
 At time 2 we can instantly deduce where the user was actually looking at time 1.
 So we can deduce the calibration error at time 1, and send this error signal
 to our on-the-fly calibration system.
</p>
<p>
 The user might not always look exactly at required targets, but  we assume that
 the contributions from the  user's other random pointing gestures will average out.
</p>
<p>
 We plan to  implement this method, and wish to ensure that the
 idea is  in the public domain, hence this web document, dated 28.6.2003.
</p><p>
 (Since 2004, this feature has been in Dasher version 3.)
</p><p>
 [Phil Cowans has a similar but much more elegant method for
 simultaneously calibrating both dimensions of an eye-tracker, x and y,
 in a Dasher-like dynamic environment.]

 A related idea is <b>deliberate miscalibration of Dasher</b>.

 While this idea is unlikely to be helpful in eyetrackers, it could
 be very useful for pen-based systems such as touch screens, tablet PCs, and palmtop
 pens driven by styluses.
 We plan to include an option in Dasher such that the
 Dasher mouse is rendered (either visibly or invisibly) in
 a location <em>offset</em> from the pointer direction delivered by the user. For example,
 a vertical offset of 10 pixels.
 This offset allows the user to steer without her stylus
 getting in the way of the crucial part of the screen.
 If a large offset is chosen, then it would probably be a good idea
 for the Dasher-mouse location to be visualized on the screen. The
 pointer could even be moved around on a completely separate part of
 the screen (just as a mouse user moves the physical mouse around on a mat,
 not on the screen!).
