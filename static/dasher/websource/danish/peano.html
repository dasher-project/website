<h2>`Peano' - Fully Two-dimensional Dasher</h2>

 - capable of using both dimensions as information sources.<br>
 David MacKay
 <br><br>
 The idea is to embed the real line from 0 to 1 in two dimensions
  by mapping it onto a Peano curve.
 <br><br>
 As an illustration of the potential benefits, the following image
 compares the regular one-dimensional-dasher view of an English bigram model (left)
 with the Peano view (right).  Many more low-probability strings are visible.
 Peano-dasher makes better use of screen real-estate.
 Whether Peano-dasher will be useable remains to be seen.
