<h2>VERSION 3!!</h2>
<p>
<b> Wed 27/11/02</b>:
 <b>Version 3 is now released for
 Windows and Linux</b>. You can
 download it from <a href=Download.html>the Dasher download page</a>.
 Windows versions for
 (windows NT, windows 2000, windows XP) and (windows 95-98) are
 available.
</p>
<p>
 Version 3 is a complete rewrite of Dasher. It should
 have all the key features of version 1.6.8, and is intended
 to be far more development-friendly.
 One of  its new  features, which we expect many users will
 appreciate, is the "automatic copy" option, which
 has the effect of copying the written text into
 the cut'n'paste buffer whenever dasher is stopped. (Enable this option using the menus.)
</p>
<p>
 Version 3.0.0 prerelease 2 supports several English alphabets.
 Support for other languages will follow soon. Portuguese is the
 first language in the queue.
</p>

</p>
<p>
 A port to ipaq-running-linux is also being made by Hanna Wallach.
</p>


<p>
 Version 3 was written by David Ward, Iain Murray, Phil Cowans,
 and Matthew Garrett. 
</p>
<p>
 Feedback on version 3 should be sent via the
 <a href="http://www.metafaq.com/faq/dasher/">metafaq system</a>
 please, or else by email to dasher-at-mrao.cam.ac.uk.
</p>

 <p><b>Tue 1/10/02</b>:
cliffn has written a <b>front end for dasher v1.6.8</b> in VB5 which allows to run 
Dasher, allows one click to save the text into a file,  and
allows the file to be read aloud.  With a shortcut to the text file 
on your desktop it is easy to edit and copy and paste to another app.
<br>
Tested only on Win 2000 but available for download with a right click 
on the file name (StartDasherFS.exe) from:
<a href=http://www.datasolutions.co.nz/Download>www.datasolutions.co.nz/Download</a>;
<em>this exe file should be put in the dasher folder alongside dasher.exe</em>.
 </p>

 <p>
<b>9/02</b>:
 <a href=/dasher/websource/english/TalkMacro.txt>This text file</a> gives Margaret Cotts's
 instructions for
 using  Macro Express  to connect Dasher 1.6.8 to
<a href=http://www.etriloquist.com/>etriloquist</a>, and further information
 submitted by other users.

<h1>Latest information about VERSION 3</h1>
<h4>Known bugs</h4>
<p>
 If you have previously installed another release of version 3,
 then 
 The windows 2000 version starts and shows nothing but a green
 square. To fix this, Click options->alphabet, and select any alphabet except "?", then click OK.
</p>

<h2>Alphabet handling</h2>
<p> Proper documentation about alphabets will be provided in the future.
 Meanwhile, here are some notes from Iain, and from a user
who has figured it out!
</p>
<h3>Alphabet handling in Windows</h3>
<p>
 Dasher stores
new alphabets and looks for user training files in:
<tt>
Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\dasher.rc
</tt>
<b>for versions of Windows that have such a folder</b>. The system settings in
system.rc are not changed. This is the equivalent of a ~/.dasher.rc
directory on a Unix system for user settings.
</p><p>
[Earlier versions of
windows simply put dasher.rc in the
<tt>\Program Files\Dasher</tt> directory -
giving all users the same settings.]
</p><p>

This makes <b>cleaning out test versions of Dasher</b> and hacking the alphabet file
directory hard, as it may not be an obvious place to look. However, it is how
Windows apps are supposed to behave. Dasher makes an API call to ask where to
save this data; it isn't just making this path up.
</p>
People wanting to hack the alphabet file directly will probably find it fairly
obvious (once they've found the file!).
</p>
<p>

They'll need a text editor that can deal with UNIX text file format. (Not
notepad, but anything decent should do.) Otherwise the file will lose its line
breaks and be hard to read.
</p>
<p>

XML purists might want to consult <tt>alphabets.dtd</tt> for the formal specification.
</p>
<p>

Others may need to be reminded to use UTF-8 encoding if they use anything
outside ASCII.
</p>
<p>

I am not sure all international issues have yet been fixed - so people
creating alphabets may still run into problems.
 
</p>
<h4>How to make your own alphabet - examples</h4>
<p>
<em>"I want numerals!"</em> -
You can use numbers right now. AFAIK, you can edit the file
alphabet.xml to include any of the basic 7 Bit ASCII characters.

<p>
</p>
If you want to, you can download <a href=http://www.bilderverbot.com/alphabet.zip>a modified alphabet definition</a>. It
provides an additional alphabet named "mixed limited +nums". This does
two things in addition to the standard "english/limited" alphabet:
<p>
</p>

- it provides numbers
<p>
</p>
- it arranges small/capital letters beneath each other, which was
optional in dasher 1.68.
<p>
The location to put this will depend on your OS.
