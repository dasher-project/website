  <h3>Starting Version 1.6.8</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Windows</b>:
	When you have installed Dasher 1.6.8 on a PC, set the dasher application
	running; when the dasher window comes up, either click the left mouse button
	or press the space bar to set it going. [One of these two will work.]
	Repeat this action (click or space), when you are finished, to stop dasher from dashing.
	Your computer's mouse controls Dasher.
  </li>
  <li><b>Linux</b>:
	When you have installed Dasher 1.6.8 on a PC, CHANGE INTO THE SAME DIRECTORY
	where the executable dasher is located, and set it
	running by typing <b>dasher</b>.   [Do not run dasher from any other location, or it will fail to
	find the training files.]
	When the dasher window comes up, either click the left mouse button
	or press the space bar to set it going. [One of these two will work.]
	Repeat this action (click or space), when you are finished, to stop dasher from dashing.

	<b>Next steps (version 1.6.8)</b><br>
	Don't press the "Experiment" menu. The "File" and "Configure" Menus are
	worth playing with, if you want upper-case characters, for example.
	Once you have passed the novice stage, if you find Dasher1.6.8 is
	moving too slow for you, please select Configure->Options
	and increase the Maxbitrate parameter.
