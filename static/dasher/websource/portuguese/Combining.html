<p>
 Many languages make use of accents or other marks
 that modify characters.
 For example, some european languages use acute, circumflex, umlaut, grave, cedilla, or macron (over-bar)
 accents, as shown in the example image above right.
</p>
<p>
 Unicode provides two ways to create such characters:
 either with a single `COMPOSED' character such as 
"&#232;",  
"&#233;",  
"&#234;", or  
"&#235;";  
 or by COMBINING a simple "e" with a second character, a `combining accent', such as 
"&#x25cc;&#x0300;", 
"&#x25cc;&#x0301;", or 
"&#x25cc;&#x0302;". When you use the second `DECOMPOSED' form,
 if the font on your computer knows what it is doing, it should replace the
 sequence
 "e&#x25cc;&#x0301;" automatically by  "&#233;" (to see if  your browser
 does it right, look at this - "e&#x0301;".
</p>
<p>
 In Dasher, there are similarly two ways to set things up so that you can 
 write characters with accents.
 The simplest method, which we used in most alphabets in  version 3,
 is to include in the alphabet all the accented
 characters, as illustrated by
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.french.xml>the upper
 alphabet in this French alphabet file</a>;
 this method is clumsy, because it makes a larger alphabet  than necessary,
 and it can be tricky for users to learn to find the accented characters.
</p><p>
 Especially if the user thinks of the accent as being written <em>after</em>
 the basic character is written, it may be more natural to use
 the second method -- an alphabet with combining characters, as
 illustrated by
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.french.xml>the second 
 alphabet in this French file</a>.
</p><p>
 This is also an elegant solution for languages in which the accents are used
 very rarely, such as English.
 For people who want to occasionally write accented words such as pass&#233;
 in English, we recommend using 
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.englishC.xml>english
 with combining characters</a>.
 For an alphabet that supplies the
full set of all combining accents needed for <b>any</b>
 Latin ISO-8859 alphabet, see
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.latin.xml>Latin ISO-8859</a>.

</p><p>
 If you use combining characters, you must be aware of three things:
 (1) the training text must also use combining characters in the same way.
 If you have a training text consisting of COMPOSED characters then you
 should convert it into decomposed form. On linux systems decomposing can be done using
 <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/perl/decompose.pl>a perl program like this</a>.
 (2) the output file will consist of decomposed characters. Not all computer programs display
 these characters correctly, so you may wish to run the output file through a <em>composing</em> filter.
 (3) It will be <em>possible</em> to write nonsense in Dasher, when you have combining
 accents, eg, to attach accents to characters
 that should not have them in that language, or stack up multiple accents in ways
 that no language allows; but the language model should make such sequences
 difficult to write.
</p><p>
 The behaviour of Dasher should be much the same whichever alphabet you use.
 The language model's predictions may be a little different when you use
 combining accents. 
</p><p>
 A third option, which will work in Dasher version 4 when nested groups are
 supported correctly, is to use a long alphabet with composed characters,
 but render the  groups  of related characters differently.
 The
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.french.xml>third French alphabet</a> 
 illustrates this option.
