<h2>Old information about languages in  Dasher version 1.6.8</h2>
<p>
 Several European languages and Japanese (Hiragana)
  are  supported in Dasher 1.6.
</p>
<h3>Instructions for Dasher version 1.6.8</h3>
<p>
 To make use of Dasher with a non-English European language, you need
 to train Dasher with a  text file full of natural writing
 in your language - put this file in the location <b>input/source</b>
 or <b>input/source.txt</b>.  Make sure the "Word" option is switched off,
 or else replace the file <b>input/dict</b> with a dictionary for your language.

<h2>Old information about Japanese</h2>
 <p>
 As a first step towards a
  full Japanese version of Dasher handling both Kana and Kanji,
   David Ward has written a Hiragana version,
 <a href=Download.html>available in version 1.6.3 of Dasher</a>.
 (NB:  windows-Dasher version 1.6.8 does not
 support Hiragana, because of Tcl font problems; the linux version
 of 1.6.8 works fine in Hiragana.)
 Hiragana is also available in version 3.2 of Dasher.
 </p>
 <p>  The conversion of Dasher to Daishoya is simple: we replace the English alphabet
  a..z by the Hiragana alphabet, <img src="/dasher/images/aiueo.gif" alt="aiueo..." width="235" height="18">
  (a,i,u,e,o, ka,ki,ku,ke,ko,...); and
   we replace the English training text by a Hiragana document. [Unfortunately,
  we have not been able to find a large pure-Hiragana  document, so
  our language model is not as well-trained as we would like.]
 </p><p> 
 Two orderings of the Hiragana alphabet are available (options "japan1"
 and "japan2"). In "japan2 (Hiragana 60)" the diacritical marks (",o) are
 included as separate characters; in "japan1 (Hiragana 83)" they are integrated
 by including the characters <img align=middle src="/dasher/images/paba.gif" alt="pa,ba" width="48" height="20">, etc.  in the  alphabet ("pa", "ba").

 As another step, on Wed 14/7/04, we added a mixed Kana/Kanji alphabet
 <a href=/dasher/japanese/jouyoukanji.html>using the Jouyou Kanji</a>.

 This is not the final solution!
