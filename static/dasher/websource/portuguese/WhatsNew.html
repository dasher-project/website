Sat 16/7/05: <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/presentations/Korean/>Dasher working in Korean</a> -
 for this to work, you need a font that understands how to <em>combine</em> the elementary
 vowels and consonants of Korean into the syllable characters.
 This works in Dasher 3.2 under linux (Ubuntu operating system) if you select one of the
 korean fonts. 
 For this version of Korean you need
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.korean.xml>this alphabet file</a>
 and a training text that is
in DECOMPOSED form
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/training/training_korean_KR.txt>like this one</a>. [We need a bigger training text!] 
 You can decompose
 a regular "combined" korean text 
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/training/training_korean2350_KR.txt>such
as this</a>
 by using (eg)<br>
<tt><a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/perl/decompose.pl>decompose.pl</a> korean.txt training_korean_KR.txt</tt>
<br>

 Thanks to Son Yeoyoung and Matthew Parker for help.
 We plan another version of Korean, using
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.koreanNested.xml>the
nested alphabet</a>
when Dasher 4.0 is released (October 2005).

a lot like one-button mode of Dasher.  In fact what it's most like
is the now-abandoned metronome mode. (The button in SF cave determines
the acceleration, rather than the velocity.)

<b>Tue 5/7/05</b>
 Would you like it to be easier to distinguish between
 the apostrophe (') and comma (,) in Dasher?
 In the
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.english.xml>latest alphabet for English</a>, we have introduced two
 modifications:
(1) 
 we render the apostrophe in the dasher display using &#x2358; (an underlined
 apostrophe) by specifying this
alphabet symbol: <center>
<tt>
&lt;s b="105" d="&amp;#x2358;" t="&amp;apos;" note=" apostrophe"/&gt;
</tt>
</center>
(2) we have coloured all the parenthesis and quote-like characters
(including apostrophe)
 in shades of magenta, and all the 
  comma and full-stop like characters in shades of slate blue. 
</p>
</div>
<div style="color:black;background-color:#f7fef3">
<p>
At the same time, we have added a TAB character, shown by a diamond (&#x25CA;),
 to the English alphabet.
We've coloured its square white/grey, like the other space-like characters.
Here is the alphabet entry.<br>
<tt>
&lt;s b="9"  d="&amp;#x25CA;" t="&amp;#x9;" note="TAB (represented by a diamond)"/&gt;
</tt>
</p>
<p>
 We have made the same changes in the following alphabets:<br>
 <b><a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.danish.xml>Danish</a></b>
 <b><a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.french.xml>French</a></b>
 <b><a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.german.xml>German</a></b>
 <b><a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.frenchC.xml>French with combining characters</a></b>
 It would be great if users could let us know if these enhanced alphabets give any
problems.

<h2>Tablet PCs</h2>
<p><b>Fri 3/9/04</b> - report by David Ward</p>
<p>
 The windows version of   Dasher works quite nicely  on a MS Tablet
 PC, with no modifications to Dasher.
</p><p> 
 The pen glides across the screen very nicely and still works with the pen
 lifted up to 1cm from the screen. I found that my pen frequently lifted
 from the tablet when using Dasher (unlike PocketPC where it is easier to
 maintain pressure) so I switched off 'start on tap' and went for 'start on
 space' instread.
</p><p> 
 Also, I had to make Dasher no larger than about 12x12cm because of the
 distance that my hand had to travel.
</p><p>
 Typing text into applications works fine -- identically to plain Windows.
</p><p> 
 Finally, TabletPC has a special input panel (containing character,
 handwriting recognition and on-screen keyboard) but as far as I can tell,
 there's no way to add Dasher to the panel.

<h2>Version 3.2</h2>
Mon 27/10/03. Version 3.2 is ready.
<a href=Version3.2.html>This page has information</a>

<h2>Breath Dasher</h2>
<b>Fri 15/8/03</b>.
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/development/breath/>A new way
of using Dasher has been created: a breath mouse moves the mouse up
and down the screen as your breath is in and out respectively.</a>
 In the first trials, an expert Dasher user achieved ten words per minute
by breath alone. 

<h2>More control mode development (Fri 25/7/03)</h2>

Application control mode is now fully integrated into the Unix code,
and is almost complete in the Windows version. We hope to make a new
release including this code shortly, but you can check out the CVS
version to try it now.

<h2>International Phonetic Alphabet (Sat 12/7/03)</h2>
 With an appropriate XML file, Dasher works
 in the International Phonetic Alphabet  (<a href="/dasher/images/IPA.gif" alt="IPA">screenshot</a>).
 If anyone can advise us on how to make this feature useful
 to users of phonetics, please let us know.


<h2>Gnome application control (Sun 22/6/03)</h2>

The current CVS version contains code that allows applications to be
controlled from within Dasher. Take a look at <a
href="/dasher/images/DasherAppControl.png">this screenshot</a> in
order to see Dasher being used to enter text into a word processor -
the bold mode was switched on and off entirely within Dasher. Code to
add the same functionality to the Windows version is currently being
worked on.

<h2>Beta version of Dasher for MacOS X (Tue 10/6/03)</h2>

A beta release of Dasher for MacOS X has been made. This version is
still under development and so may behave unpredictably, crash, eat
your files or be generally miserable. Download it from the <a
href="Download.html">download page</a>. Thanks to Doug Dickinson and
Iain Murray for their work on this port! Click <a
href="/dasher/images/new/DasherMacOSX.png">here</a> for a
screenshot.

<h2>Dasher support IRC channel (Fri 2/5/03)</h2>

There is now an IRC channel for Dasher support and development issues. Simply
connect to irc.freenode.org and join #dasher.

<h2>Palm developer volunteers wanted (Thu 1/5/03)</h2>

A port of Dasher to the Palm has been impractical up until fairly recently due to the low refresh rate of the screens and relatively slow processor More recent hardware solves both of these problems, so we're looking for volunteers to look at porting Dasher to PalmOS. If you're interested, please contact Matthew Garrett at dasher[AT]mrao.cam.ac.uk

<h2>Anonymous CVS access now available (Thu 1/5/03)</h2>

Anonymous CVS access to the Dasher development tree is now available. To 
download the current source, run
<p>
<pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@coll.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk:/home/cvsroot/dasher login

 Matthew will coordinate contributions to the source code
 and feedback from users. Please see <a href=Develop.html>the development page</a>
 for the recommended feedback methods.

<h2>VERSION 3!!</h2>
<p>
<b> Wed 27/11/02</b>:
 <b>Version 3 is now released for
 Windows and Linux</b>. You can
 download it from <a href=Download.html>the Dasher download page</a>.
 Windows versions for
 (windows NT, windows 2000, windows XP) and (windows 95-98) are
 available.
</p>
<p>
 Version 3 is a complete rewrite of Dasher. It should
 have all the key features of version 1.6.8, and is intended
 to be far more development-friendly.
 One of  its new  features, which we expect many users will
 appreciate, is the "automatic copy" option, which
 has the effect of copying the written text into
 the cut'n'paste buffer whenever dasher is stopped. (Enable this option using the menus.)
</p>
<p>
 Version 3.0.0 prerelease 2 supports several English alphabets.
 Support for other languages will follow soon. Portuguese is the
 first language in the queue.
</p>
<p>
<b> <a href=WhatsNew3.html>Further information about Dasher version 3</a> </b>
</p>
<p>
 A port to ipaq-running-linux is also being made by Hanna Wallach.
</p>


<p>
 Version 3 was written by David Ward, Iain Murray, Phil Cowans,
 and Matthew Garrett. 
</p>
<p>
 Feedback on version 3 should be sent via the
 <a href="http://www.metafaq.com/faq/dasher/">metafaq system</a>
 please, or else by email to dasher-at-mrao.cam.ac.uk.
</p>

 <p><b>Tue 1/10/02</b>:
cliffn has written a <b>front end for dasher v1.6.8</b> in VB5 which allows to run 
Dasher, allows one click to save the text into a file,  and
allows the file to be read aloud.  With a shortcut to the text file 
on your desktop it is easy to edit and copy and paste to another app.

HiddenPage Combining accents
<h3>Combining-accents in French</h3>
 For many European languages, we feel it might be most
 natural to write using the 26 latin characters (a-z), plus 
 accents that are added afterwards. 
 [This  is how Unicode's designers encourage us to 
 represent accents also.]
 Using 
 this new alphabet,
 and 
 setting the Dasher edit-box font to <b>ClearlyU</b>, 
 I got this idea working nicely.
 In this first prototype, the new accent group is contained in an 
 <b>orange</b> box, and the accents themselves appear in yellow boxes. 
 All the accents (acute, circumflex, cedilla, grave) 
 were written in this way in the screenshot shown.

<center>
<img src="images/FrenchCombining.png" alt="images/FrenchCombining" width="496" height="567">
</center>

 This approach makes European languages much more alike 
 in Dasher. 
 We can use a single alphabet file and train it in any language, 
 as long as the training text is appropriately <a href=/mackay/perl/decompose.pl>decomposed</a>.

<img align=right src="/dasher/images/logo35.png" alt="logo" width="35" height="35">

<h1>Latest information about VERSION 3</h1>
<h4>Known bugs</h4>
<p>
 If you have previously installed another release of version 3,
 then 
 The windows 2000 version starts and shows nothing but a green
 square. To fix this, Click options->alphabet, and select any alphabet except "?", then click OK.
</p>

<h2>Alphabet handling</h2>
<p> Proper documentation about alphabets will be provided in the future.
 Meanwhile, here are some notes from Iain, and from a user
who has figured it out!
</p>
<h3>Alphabet handling in Windows</h3>
<p>
 Dasher stores
new alphabets and looks for user training files in:
<tt>
Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\dasher.rc
</tt>
<b>for versions of Windows that have such a folder</b>. The system settings in
system.rc are not changed. This is the equivalent of a ~/.dasher.rc
directory on a Unix system for user settings.
</p><p>
[Earlier versions of
windows simply put dasher.rc in the
<tt>\Program Files\Dasher</tt> directory -
giving all users the same settings.]
</p><p>

This makes <b>cleaning out test versions of Dasher</b> and hacking the alphabet file
directory hard, as it may not be an obvious place to look. However, it is how
Windows apps are supposed to behave. Dasher makes an API call to ask where to
save this data; it isn't just making this path up.
</p>
People wanting to hack the alphabet file directly will probably find it fairly
obvious (once they've found the file!).
</p>
<p>

They'll need a text editor that can deal with UNIX text file format. (Not
notepad, but anything decent should do.) Otherwise the file will lose its line
breaks and be hard to read.
</p>
<p>

XML purists might want to consult <tt>alphabets.dtd</tt> for the formal specification.
</p>
<p>

Others may need to be reminded to use UTF-8 encoding if they use anything
outside ASCII.
</p>
<p>

I am not sure all international issues have yet been fixed - so people
creating alphabets may still run into problems.
 
</p>
<h4>How to make your own alphabet - examples</h4>
<p>
<em>"I want numerals!"</em> -
You can use numbers right now. AFAIK, you can edit the file
alphabet.xml to include any of the basic 7 Bit ASCII characters.

<p>
</p>
If you want to, you can download <a href=http://www.bilderverbot.com/alphabet.zip>a modified alphabet definition</a>. It
provides an additional alphabet named "mixed limited +nums". This does
two things in addition to the standard "english/limited" alphabet:
<p>
</p>

- it provides numbers
<p>
</p>
- it arranges small/capital letters beneath each other, which was
optional in dasher 1.68.
<p>
The location to put this will depend on your OS.

</p>
