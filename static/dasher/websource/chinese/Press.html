<p><b>Writing fast without a keyboard</b></p>
<p>
  A new text entry system developed at Cambridge University could transform computing for people unable to use a normal keyboard.

The text entry system, called Dasher, designed by David MacKay and David Ward in the University's Department of Physics,  can 
be controlled by an eyetracker - a camera that tracks where on the screen the user is looking.
</p><p>
'The software works like a video game in which the user steers ever deeper into an enormous library,' explained Dr MacKay. 
'A  language model is used to shape this library in such a way that it's quick and easy to select probable sequences of characters and hard to make spelling mistakes.'
</p><p>

The system, which is described in today's Nature (22 August 2002), is much faster than any alternative writing systems driven by an eyetracker.
Experiments show that with practice, Dasher can produce up to 25 words per minute. Users writing with other eyetracker-based techniques, using on-screen keyboards, can produce only 15 words per minute.
'Not only is this faster than any alternative writing system driven by an eyetracker, the frequency of spelling mistakes is about five
 times smaller - and the new system is also less stressful to use,' added Dr MacKay.
 </p><p>

Dasher is distinctive because it is controlled by continuous pointing
gestures, so it uses humans' natural ability to make high-precision
analogue movements. A keyboard, where the hands use all-or-nothing
movements to produce text, wastes this ability.</p><p>
  Dasher also makes no
distinction between word completion and ordinary writing. Other
writing systems will suggest completed words in a separate part of the
display and the user has to point or stare at them to choose
them. Dasher's suggestions are integrated seamlessly into the writing
process. The language model adapts to an individual user's
writing style, so that sometimes several words can be written with a
single glance.  </p>

<p> Dasher will be particularly useful for computer users who are
unable to type using a conventional keyboard. Because it can be driven
using any pointing device - mouse, rollerball, touchpad, or eyetracker
- it is also useful for handheld computers or mobile phones where
there is no space for a keyboard.  It also has potential as an
input system for other languages, such as Japanese.</p><p>
  David MacKay and
David Ward plan to develop Dasher as an `Open Source' software
project, like Linux.  </p>

<b><a name=q01>Why did you invent Dasher?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p> I (David MacKay) was convinced that standard text-entry systems (such as
    ten-finger keyboards) are very inefficient - they don't make
    use of the predictability of natural language,
    and they waste our capabilities of making high-precision
    gestures.
    </p><p>
    I believed that by starting from a principled foundation - namely
    information theory - we could make completely new writing systems
    that could have hardware  much smaller than keyboards, and yet work
    nearly as fast,
    and that could  be integrated with pointing systems such as eyetrackers.
    
</p>
</dd>
<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q02>Who is  Dasher aimed at?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p>
 There are several different groups of people who will
 find Dasher useful. What they all have in common is that
 they  want an alternative to the regular ten-finger keyboard.
 </p>
<ul>
<li><p> The largest group of people who can't use full-size keyboards
	are <b>palmtop computer users</b>.
	Many people who've downloaded the version of
	Dasher for pocket PC say they find it
	easy to learn and enjoyable to use.
	</p>
</li>
<li> <p> The group for whom we think Dasher offers the biggest
	benefits are <b>people with special needs</b>.
	Many people who can't use a ten-finger keyboard, but
	who can use a regular mouse,  joystick,  roller ball,  touch screen,
	or  head-mouse
	(and who can see their computer screen),
	will  find Dasher useful.
	 Within 10 minutes, such  users 
	 can write with Dasher at speeds in the range of 5 to 15 words per
	 minute.  After 60 minutes of practice, writing speeds range from 15
	 to 25 words per minute. With further practice, 
	 39 words per minute can be reached.
</p><p>
	For <b>severely disabled people</b> who cannot use
	any of the above pointing systems, but who do have the
	use of their eyes,  Dasher offers big potential benefits
	if it is used with an <b>eyetracker</b>.  With practice, writing
	speeds of 20-25 words per minute can be achieved.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>	Another group for whom regular "qwerty" keyboards
	are inconvenient are Japanese computer users.
	The roman alphabet is unfamiliar to many of them, so writing
	in Japanese via a roman keyboard is cumbersome.
	Dasher can be used in almost any language, and we
	have made a Japanese prototype that allows one to write in
	the phonetic Hiragana alphabet.

<b><a name=q10>What gave you the idea for the inverse-arithmetic-coding interface?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p>
 I (David MacKay) was on a bus to Denver airport with Mike Lewicki on
 December 7th 1997.
 I was entering something in my PDA (a Psion 3a, which has a small qwerty keyboard),
 and Mike commented `gee, that thing is so big!'
 And this set us thinking, `how could we make a smaller PDA, given that the
 limiting thing is the keyboard?'
 We brainstormed about how to make a device with a tiny display mounted
 on a pair of glasses and with an input device no bigger than 2cm by 2cm,
 which could be attached to the lapel of your jacket. You'd drive it
 with your finger.
 </p>
 <p>
We were convinced that we could make something much more efficient than
a regular keyboard; the keyboard is inefficient for
two reasons. First, in ordinary writing, every character must be entered by
a distinct finger-gesture; but ordinary text is highly redundant - highly
predictable. The information content of ordinary text
is only one or two bits per character. So one of our aims
was to incorporate a language model into the heart of the text entry
device to exploit this predictability and reduce the load on the user.
Second, human fingers, although they are called `digits',
are <em>analogue</em> devices, capable of fine continuous
gestures. The clunky keyboard throws away our ability to make
high-precision gestures by forcing us to make binary gestures
as we tap the keys. We estimated that a single finger can in principle
generate information at a rate of about 24 bits per second.
</p><p>
 If we could find a new way to couple a single finger (producing
 information  at 24 bits per second) to a really good language model
 (which knows how to compress text into one bit per character)
 then perhaps we could write at 24 characters per second!
</p><p>
 At this point I had the idea of making an inverse-arithmetic-coder.
 
</p><p>
 The user could steer the interface with two-dimensional pointing,
 on a 2-d trackpad for example;
 and in fact since the user would be looking where they were
 going, we didn't even need the trackpad: we could use an eyetracker
 to obtain the same steering information.
</p><p>
 Thus was born the idea of `Dasher'. (This name was Mike's suggestion.)
 Mike reckoned the best way to write a prototype would be in the
 Tcl language, and by the time we got to Denver airport, Mike had
 taught me enough Tcl that I had knocked together a primitive
 zooming interface.
</p><p>
 Within another week I had finished the first prototype.
</p><p>
 I had an additional motivation for making this prototype of Dasher:
 since Dasher is  an inverse arithmetic coder, it served as
 a handy teaching aid for <em>teaching</em> arithmetic coding in
 my Senior course on <em>Information Theory, Pattern Recognition,
 and Neural Networks</em>.  
 I've used it to teach arithmetic coding every year since January 1998.

<dt>
<b><a name=q11>How  does the text entry method work? Can you describe it so I can picture it?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p>
 It's hard to explain in words. Even with pictures, it's hard to explain!
 <small>(<a href=Novice.html>An online explanation with pictures can be found here</a>)</small>
 It's easiest to explain by a live  demonstration.
 Anyway, here goes.
 </p><p>
  Imagine  <b>a library containing all possible books</b>,
  ordered alphabetically on a single shelf.
  (Yes, I mean <em>all</em> possible books. This library
  is sometimes called the Library of Babel.)
  Books in which the first letter is "a" are
  at the left hand side.
  Books in which the first letter is "z" are at the right.
  The first book in the "a" section
  reads "aaaaaaaaaaaa..."; somewhere to its right are
  books that start "all good things
   must come to an end...";
   a tiny bit further to the right are books that
   start "all good things must come to an enema...".
   </p>
 <p>  
 When someone writes a piece of text, their choice
 of the text string can be viewed as a choice of a book
 from this library of all books - namely, the book that contains exactly the
 chosen text.
 How do they choose that book? Let's imagine they want
 to write "all good things..."
 </p><p>  

 First, they walk into the "a" section of the library.
 There, they are confronted by books starting "aa", "ab", "ac,.... "az"
 Looking more closely at the "al" section, they can find books
 starting "ala", "alb",... "alz"
 </p>

<p>
 By looking ever more closely at the shelf, the writer
  can find the book containing the text he wishes to write.
  Thus writing can be described as  <b>zooming in on
  an alphabetical library, steering as you go</b>.
</p><p>
  This is exactly how Dasher works, except for one crucial point:
  <em>we alter the SIZE of the shelf space devoted to each
  book in proportion to <b>the probability</b> of the
  corresponding text.</em>
  For example, not very many books start with an "x", so we devote
  less space to "x..." books, and more to the
  more plausible books, thus making it easier to find
  books that contain probable text.
</p><p>
 The result is that instead of having the laborious feeling of
 selecting one letter at a time - as on a typewritter -
 the user has the feeling that whole syllables, whole words,
 even whole phrases, are simply leaping towards him.
</p><p>
	The user steers by pointing where he wants to go. The display zooms
	in towards wherever the user points.
	And because the user is typically looking where he wants
	to go, it's not essential for the user to point; we can simply
	track his eyes and use gaze direction as the pointer.

<dt>
<b><a name=q12>How  does arithmetic coding work? Can you describe this so I can picture it?</a>

</b></dt><dd><p>
 Arithmetic coding is a beautiful text compression method.
 It normally takes me a one-hour lecture to explain it.
 </p><p>
 Imagine a ruler (a straightedge) of length one foot.
 Put a mark half-way down it. Label the left half "0" and the right half "1".
 Now halve the left half, and label the two quarters "00" and "01".
 Similarly, halve the right half, and label the two quarter "10" and "11".
 Now we have defined six intervals: "0" and "1"; and "00", "01", "10", and "11".
 We can keep subdividing the last four, and get eight intervals such as "000" and "101".
 Thus, any little chunk of ruler can be associated with a binary string.
 </p>
 <p>
	Now, text compression depends on there being <em>redundancy</em>
	in the text, and any redundancy can be described by a probabilistic model,
	which says what the probability of the first character in the document is,
	and what the probability of the second is, given the first, and so forth.
	Arithmetic coding assumes that you have got such a model from somewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
	Let's take the predictions of the probabilistic model: say the predictions
	for the probabilities of the first character (a,b,c,....z) are P(a)=0.05;
	P(b)=0.02; P(c)=0.03; ... P(e)=0.10; ... P(t)=0.20; ....
	</p>
	<p>
	We can use these probabilities to slice up the ruler. The left-hand 5%
	of the ruler is called "a"; the next 2% is called "b"; and so forth.
	</p><p>
	Then we can subdivide the ruler's "a" portion into "aa", "ab", "ac",...
	in proportion to the probabilities assigned by the probabilistic model
	when we ask `assuming the first character is an "a", what's
	the probability of the second character?'
	</p><p>
	In this way, every possible string of characters is associated with a
	little fragment of ruler. Then the arithmetic coding method simply
	encodes the given string by finding the shortest <em>binary</em> string
	associated with the same chunk of ruler.
 </p>
</dd>
<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q13>How does the model adapt to the writer's language?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
	We use a language model called PPM (prediction by partial match).
	This language model makes its predictions by counting how often each
	letter occurred in similar contexts in the training text.
	The model can easily be adapted by adding whatever the user writes
	to the training-text database.
	It works with almost any language.
</dd>
<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q14>How tiring is the method for the writer's eyes?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p>
	We can't imagine a more user-friendly method for writing with
	one's eyes. It's similar to driving a car. When you drive a car,
	your eyes spend much of the time looking at the  point that you want to drive
	towards. So in principle, you could imagine getting rid of the
	steering wheel and simply having the car steer towards wherever
	your eyes are looking.  This  hands-free  driving system would
	not be any harder on the driver's eyes than regular driving.
</p><p>
	Similarly, writing with Dasher feels almost effortless. You simply look
	on the screen for the first  syllable you want to write; it zooms past you,
	and the next possible syllables appear; most of the time, the next
	one you want is easy to spot, and you spot it, and it zooms by, and
	the next options appear.  No conscious control of the eyes is needed.
</p><p>
Using simple and cheap eyetrackers, for any application, can be tiring
because the eyetrackers can be confused by a blinking eye or poor
calibration. However, this is a problem of those eyetrackers, not
Dasher.
	</p>
</dd>
<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q15>How fast is the method compared to other text-entry methods?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
</p><p>
 Our paper,
 <a href=/mackay/abstracts/eyeshortpaper.html>Fast Hands-free Writing by Gaze Direction</a>,
 published in <em>Nature</em> on August 22  2002, describes
 a comparison of Dasher-driven-by-an-eyetracker
 with an on-screen keyboard, with word-completion, driven by an eyetracker.
 Dasher users  could write at up to <b>25 words per minute</b>
after an hour of practice.
On-screen keyboard users  could write at  only  <em>15 words
per minute</em> after the same time. Moreover, the <b>error rate</b> when using the
on-screen keyboard
was about  <em>five times</em> that of Dasher.
It's hard to make spelling mistakes with Dasher, because the language model
makes it easy to select correct spellings.
</p><p>
Speed and error-rate are not the only important  factors.
Users who tried both systems
 reported that they found  the on-screen keyboard more
 stressful  for two reasons.  First, one  feels uncertain
 whether an error has been made in the current word (the word-completion feature
 only works if no errors have been made); one can  spot an error only
 by looking away from the keyboard. Second, at every character, one has to decide
 whether to use the word completion or to continue typing; looking
 in the word-completion area is  a gamble since one cannot be sure
 that the required word will be there;  finding the right completion requires
 a switch to a new mental activity.
</p><p>

 In contrast, Dasher users
 can  see simultaneously the last few characters they have written
 and the most probable options for the next few. And 
 Dasher is a mode-free device:
 it makes no distinction between word-completion and ordinary writing. 
</p><p>
 We have also compared Dasher, <b>driven by a mouse</b>, with
 other pointer-based text-entry systems.
 All users get faster with practice, and expert writing speeds,
 using a mouse, have reached <b>39 words per minute</b>.
 This is not as fast as full, ten-finger typing speeds on a full-size keyboard,
   but of course we require  neither a bulky keyboard nor the two hands required
 to use it. We are using only one finger!

<dt>
<b><a name=q15a>How long does it take to learn to write English with Dasher?</a>

</b></dt><dd><p>
We can tell you results for the mouse-driven version of Dasher,
and for the eye-tracking version.
<ul><li>
 Using a <b>mouse</b> to steer: Within 10 minutes, novice users of Dasher 
 can write in English at speeds in the range of 5 to 15 words per
 minute.  After 60 minutes of practice, writing speeds range from 15
 to 25 words per minute. Our most experienced Dasher user, David Ward,
 can write at 39 words per minute.
<a href= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/djw30/dasher/exp.html)>(Some Experimental results online)</a>
</li>
<li>
 With the <b>eye-tracker</b>, novices can write English at 7 words per minute
 after 10 minutes, and at 12-15 words per minute after 60 minutes
 practice.  Users with more experience of Dasher can write at 20-25
 words per minute.
</li>

</ul>
 </p>

<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q16>Can you describe a person writing a couple sentences using your method vs. using the standard on-screen keyboard?</a>

</b></dt><dd><p>
 When you use a standard on-screen keyboard,
 you have to stare at the first character you want
 for a specified dwell time (half a second, say), then
 stare at the next character, and so forth. This feels
 terribly slow and tiring. Eyes did not evolve
 to press buttons! If you reduce the dwell time,
 it still feels slow and tiring, though not quite so slow
 as before; but the reduced dwell time leads to errors,
 because you accidentally `dwell' on incorrect keys.
 To speed up your writing, you have the option of
 looking at a small number of extra keys at the
 top of the keyboard in which word-completions are
 offered.  Because you can only read what you are looking
 at, the only way to find out what word-completions are
 on offer is to make the decision to go and look
 in this word-completion area. You then have to scan around,
 trying not to dwell for too long on any displayed word,
 and either select the right word, if you find it, by staring
 at it, or give up and revert to typing. If you  revert to typing,
 you had better remember what letter you just got to! You can
 remind yourself what letter you got to only by looking in
 another area of the screen.
 It's hard to know if you have made  errors when typing,
 so the value of word-completion is reduced.
 It's likely you'll spell a number of words wrong in your sentence.
 </p>
 <p>
When you write the same sentence using Dasher, the initial display
shows all characters a-z vertically. You look at
 the first character of the sentence, and the display zooms
in on that character, revealing continuations of the sentence
inside the first character; you look at the continuation you want,
and the display zooms in on that. The whole process is continuous.
There are no discrete acts of selection. Just a little to the left
of where one is looking, one can see the characters one has already
chosen queuing up to the left; to the right,
one can see possible continuations, arranged alphabetically.
It feels like you're being offered word-completions,
and at the same time, what you're doing is writing by selecting
letters from the alphabet.
 Errors are rare, once you have used Dasher for an hour or so. If you do
 make an error, you typically notice right away, because
 the model doesn't predict the characters you want to write next.
 You can correct errors by backing up -- looking to the left of the
 screen instead of the right -- then going forwards again.

<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q17>What were the technical challenges you had to address in order to make Dasher work?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p>
 David Ward did the hard work of turning the prototype into
 a fast, useable, effective, and beautiful piece of software,
 and testing it.
  Important issues were
  <ul>
  <li> the trade-off between
  using the CPU to refresh the moving image on the
  computer screen, and using the CPU to compute additional predictions
  of the language model;
  <li> the details of nonlinearities in the rendering
  of the screen-image and nonlinearities in Dasher's
  dynamics. The original linear version worked OK, but
  David managed to enhance the maximum writing speed substantially
  by introducing clever nonlinearities.
  </ul>
  The limiting factor in the eyetracking version of Dasher
  is the resolution of the eye-tracker.
</p>
</dd>
<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q18>Was there anything surprising about the results?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p> We were delighted with how much faster we can write with
 Dasher and an eyetracker than the writing speeds many disabled
 computer users report.  We know of one user who can write at only
 6-9 words per minute. We hope that he'll give Dasher a try, because
 it can probably triple his writing speed.
 </p>
</dd>
<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q18b>You say Dasher produced less spelling errors than standard methods. But were those 
errors evaluated in terms of seriousness? I mean, a mispelling is easily 
detected by a reader. A different word acidentally chosen can change the 
whole meaning. Have you evaluated this qualitative aspect?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p> That's a very good question. We haven't formally investigated this issue,
 but I can give you some raw data, and an informal impression. I think most of
 the misspellings were minor, and many of them were caused by uncertainty about
 how to spell Jane Austen's prose!<br>
 Here is what I wrote in my 9th eyetracking session, in which I made 5 errors,
  according to the graph.
 [Punctuation and upper case characters were
 not required, except that ends of sentences were meant to be marked with '__'.]

</pre>
 And the correct text (with error locations highlighted by *) was
 <pre>The*Woodhouses were first in consequence there.  All looked up to
them.  She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was
universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in
lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change;
and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,
till her father awoke, and made it n*ecessary to be cheerful.  His
spirits required support.  He was a nervous man, easily depressed;
fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;
hating change of every kind.
</pre>

This example shows  two  errors that are not  severe. I can't spot the other three!
Let's look at another example, trial 12. (4 errors according to the graph.)

</pre>

<pre>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having
rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too
well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy
to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present so
unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes *with*
*her*.  Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of
any disagreeable consciousness.-- Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss
Taylor's loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day of
this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any
continuance.
</pre>
 Again, in this example, I can only find two errors (the two omitted words).
 I hope these examples give an impression of how reliable Dasher
 is, once one has some practice.
 It is hard to make mistakes, because one can always see what one
 has just written. If one wrote the wrong word, one
 would notice, I think.

<b><a name=q18a> How much computing power does Dasher require?</a></b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Dasher can easily be run on any standard PC (running Windows or Linux). It also runs fine 
on the more-powerful palmtop computers such as the pocket PC.         
The eyetracking version of Dasher has only been used with standard PCs
thus far, as we haven't come across a palmtop with an eyetracker :-)

<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q19>
How does your work fit into the body of work on text compression, on text entry, and on human-computer interaction in general, and what is different about it?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p>
 Dasher is distinctive because it uses 
 human body's natural  continuous
 gestures, rather than forcing the human to emit binary gestures (as in typing)
 or discrete symbols (as in handwriting or `graffiti').
  Eyes are good at navigation and search, and those are the skills
  that the eyetracking version of Dasher  uses.
</p><p>
 Dasher is also distinctive because it integrates a language model
 into a writing system in a mode-free manner.
 Many writing systems use a language model to offer word-completions,
 but accepting a word-completion involves a change in mode.
 We think Dasher is especially easy to use because it does
 not require these mode-changing decisions.
</p><p>
 Dasher is also distinctive because it requires little learning.
 If the user is familiar with the  alphabetical order used
 on the screen, then the only skill to learn
 is a simple steering skill analogous to the skill of steering
 a car.  This skill is transferrable.
 If an experienced user wishes to write in Hiragana (the Japanese phonetic
 alphabet) instead of English, he can do so instantly.
 All we need to do is train the language model on Hiragana,
 and load up the right fonts. A user who can write at 25 words per minute
 in English will be able to write at 25 words per minute in Japanese
 too (assuming he knows both languages!).
 Similarly, in English, we can add extra characters to the Dasher alphabet (for example
 upper case as well as lower case), and the user is able to write
 just as fast as before, even though the number of characters
 available has doubled.
 Extra characters for European languages can easily be included.
 There is no need to make major modifications in order to add
 ten accented characters to the alphabet, as there would be
 in other approaches using keyboards or graffiti.
</p><p>
 Dasher's use of training text is distinctive. Many  systems
 that employ language models presume that the language consists
 of words, and the predictions of the model are embodied in
 word-completions. Our language model makes no such
 presumption, but it often behaves like a word-completion
 system. Moreover,
 Dasher often does a good job
 of predicting what word comes next.
But  Dasher does this without having any concept
of "words".   If a user chose to write documents in which
 the space characters are omitted, or replaced by "X",
 the language model will work just fine; if the user
 repeatedly uses entire phrases, then Dasher will behave
 like a phrase-completion device. 
 </p><p>
 Dasher can be instantly personalized: simply train the language model
 on some example documents similar to the one you intend to write.
 </p><p>
 Dasher works instantly in any language: simply train the language
 model with example documents in the desired language.

<b><a name=q20>How could this research eventually be applied practically? What other types of uses might the efficient method for text compression eventually lead to?</a>

</b></dt><dd>
<p>
	We think that Dasher could be used in at least three
	communities, and that the software that David Ward has created
	is almost ready for use in at least one of them.
	</p>
	<p>
	First, the disabled community: Dasher offers a way to enter text into
	computers for people who cannot use ten-finger qwerty keyboards.
	Some disabled computer users who have generously  tested
	 Dasher  report that they find it
	far better than any other writing method they have tried.
	We expect that Dasher, controlled by a touch-pad,
	joystick, mouse, head-mouse, roller-ball, or eyetracker,
	will transform the writing speed of many disabled users.
	</p>
	<p>
	Second, Dasher offers a new keyboardless text-entry method
	for computer users in extreme environments.
	Until now, head-mounted displays for tiny portable computers  have hardly
	taken off at all; we think the reason for this is that an appropriate
	text-entry method has been lacking.  Dasher driven by an eyetracker
	or a miniature trackpad offers a new solution to this problem.
	We have developed a version of Dasher that runs on a pocket PC.
	Maybe some palmtop users will prefer to use Dasher for text entry.
	
	</p>
	<p>
	Third, we believe that Dasher might be especially useful to
	Japanese computer-users.  Many Japanese users are only slightly familiar
	with the qwerty alphabet, yet most computers in Japan have
	qwerty keyboards; so writing in Japanese on a keyboard is quite slow.
	 Dasher offers a way to write in Japanese that bypasses the qwerty keyboard.
	 We are at present testing a Hiragana prototype.
	</p>
	<p>
Other more speculative uses for Dasher include:
<dl>
 <hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
 <b>Hybrid voice-dasher system</b>
 </dt>
 <dd> Speak into an imperfect speech-recognizer, and watch as
 its inferences are displayed as predictions; wherever it is
 not sure what you said, use Dasher to steer into the correct
 sentence. Much easier than having to correct errors by
 saying further speech-commands!
</dd>
 <hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
 <b>Hybrid automatic translation-Dasher system</b>
 </dt>
 <dd> Assume we have a poor translation system that translates
 badly from French to English. An expert has to zip through
 the translation and clean up errors.
 This cleaning-up could be done within Dasher, using
 the output of the translator to define a language model.

<dt>
<b><a name=q21>Where is this type of input going in the long-term?</a>

</b></dt><dd><p>
 I think the long term is already here.
 Right now, one of our disabled friends is using  Dasher to write documents.
 We are ready now for product development, shrink-wrapping, and promotion.
 </p>
</dd>
<hr noshade size=1>
<dt>
<b><a name=q21a>You said that Dasher can work in most languages.
	 How do you think it might be used in Japanese?</a>

</b></dt><dd><p>
  As a first step towards a full Japanese version of Dasher
  handling both Kana and Kanji, David Ward has written a Hiragana version, "Daishoya",
  available in Windows version 1.6.3 of Dasher
  and Linux versions 1.6.3-1.6.8.
  <br>
  A demonstration of "Daishoya" being used to write
  <img src="/dasher/images/howareyouH.gif" alt="howareyouH" width="109" height="17">
  (hajime mashite) can be reached from 
  <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Languages.html>www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Languages.html</a>.
  <br>
  The conversion of Dasher to Daishoya is simple: we replace the English alphabet
  a..z by the Hiragana alphabet, <img src="/dasher/images/aiueo.gif" alt="aiueo..." width="235" height="18">
  (a,i,u,e,o,ka,ki,ku,ke,ko...). 
  We replace the English training text by a Hiragana document. [Unfortunately,
  we have not been able to find a large pure-Hiragana  document, so
  our language model is not as well-trained as we would like.]
  <br>
    Daishoya then allows you to write Hiragana text without a
  keyboard.
  <br>
  In the long term, we can imagine two ways of using Daishoya to write Kanji:
  <ol>
  <li> We could add a special
  character (like the enter key  in Japanese Word) meaning "convert to Kanji",
   and use a language model to predict which Kanji are the most probable
   in the given context and given the Hiragana sequence just written.
  All the  probable  Kanji would be displayed in boxes of size
   proportional to their probability, in accordance with the Dasher method.
   The user would zoom into the desired Kanji.
  </li>
  <li>
  We could make a new version of Daishoya in which the symbols in the
  alphabet are not Kana, but  Kanji  elements - single strokes, for example.
  The user would build up each Kanji character by adding one element at
  a time. 
  </li>

 a keyboard, faster than they could write before. This dream has been
 realised.
</p><p>
 We are continuing to research the following topics:
 <ul>
 <li>
	How to improve the language model. It's already pretty good,
	but we can imagine that an extra 20% improvement in speed
	by improving the language model's compression by 20%.
 </li>
 <li>
	Automatic calibration of the eyetracker.
	At present poor calibration of the eyetracker limits
	the performance of Dasher with eyetracker.
	We believe we can automatically tune the eyetracker on
	the fly, using the information supplied by the user's
	steering corrections.
 </li>
 <li>
	Enhancements to the navigation mechanism for the eyetracker.
	When errors need to be corrected (which is not often!),
	 the present version feels clumsy. We are working on
	 a modified version of the navigation mechanism that
	 will allow several alternative ways to back up and
	 correct errors.

<b><a name=q23a>Why make Dasher open source?</a>
</b></dt><dd>
<p> Our work  benefits immensely from the use of free software.
<ul>
<li>
	We use the <b>linux</b> operating system, provided free by Linus Torvalds.
</li>
<li>
	We use the <b>gcc</b> compiler and <b>emacs</b> editor, provided free by Richard Stallman.
</li>
<li>
	We use <b>TeX</b> and <b>LaTeX</b>, provided free by Donald Knuth and
	Leslie Lamport.
</li>
<li>
	We use <b>tcl</b> (Ousterhout), X windows (lots of people), bash (Brian Fox),
	and hundreds of other pieces of free software.
</li>
</ul>
 Having benefitted so much, it is clear to us that free software makes the
 world a happier place. We would have to have a good reason <em>not</em> to
 make our work free. 
</p>
<p>
	Our work at the University is mainly publicly funded. UK Taxpayers
	pay for the costs of the University. US taxpayers also
	paid for some of the	software we use.
</p>
<p>
	The most compelling reason for making  software free
	is that the world is a more fun place to live in
	if everyone shares freely.   
</p>
<p>
	Making Dasher `free' software does not prevent businesses from
	selling it, as for example Red Hat sells Linux.
	If businesses do profit from Dasher, we would encourage
	them to make an appropriate donation to support our continuing
	work.  The Dasher project was supported by the 
	generosity of IBM Zurich research labs, who gave
	David MacKay a partnership award in recognition of
	his earlier freely-shared work on error-correcting codes.
</p>
<p>
	We plan to distribute Dasher under the GNU public license (<a href= "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>)
	initially.
	[A later version of Dasher may be distributed  under the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a> if there is demand.] These licenses allow anyone to use the source
	code, and ensure that modified versions of the source code
	remain equally free to everyone.

<b> Let me get this straight. Dasher seems like a really good idea and one
 that has the potential to be enormously popular (esp. in Japanese market)
 yet you are making it open source (for reasons you explain above).
 Doesn't this mean that palm or sony or someone could make a killing from
 your idea?
</b>
</dt>

<dd><p>Yes, it's conceivable that a company will incorporate 
Dasher into their product and it will boost their sales. If so, 
good for them, and I hope they might give something back in return 
to the Free Software Community - we'd like support for a software 
development manager for Dasher in my group, for example. 
</p><p>
There's three reasons why I think software patents are a bad idea:
</p><p>
First, patents inhibit open discussion - it's no fun doing science 
in a secretive environment, and communication is essential for 
progress; it's unlikely I could recruit PhD students to work on ideas
like Dasher if I forced them to keep my ideas secret; Dasher would 
never have got off the ground.
</p><p>

Second, software patents prevent the best software solutions from 
being used - a good example is the widely used "gif" format for images:
compuserve and Unisys are apparently enforcing a patent on the compression 
algorithm that used to be used to make gif images nice and small.
So everyone is essentially having to stop using what used to be a nice 
simple standard.
</p><p>

Third, I think it is pretty rare that the deserving inventor actually 
gets anything financially from a software patent. <b>You can't win</b>.
The people who benefit
from patents are (a) patent lawyers; and (b) big corporations, which 
use patents as threatened weapons to force other companies to do deals.
If I had a patent and a big corporation violated it, what could I do?
They have more money to pour into legal battles than I do.  And they would 
no doubt counter-sue, alleging that I was infringing a stack of their
patents.  Even in the physical world, patents seem pretty useless. Look 
at Mr Dyson with his bagless vacuum cleaners.  Didn't Hoover infringe 
his patent anyway, and didn't it take him ten years of misery in 
court to get this recognised?
