<h2>Other Dasher-like interfaces written outside our group</h2>
<a href=http://www.jagex.com/circles/test.html>A "Circular" version of
 dasher, written in Java</a>

 While we appreciate the hommage to our work, we think this
 implementation throws away the essential feature of dasher,
 namely information-efficiency. The user is able to zoom in on
 inter-circle regions that do not correspond to any string, so
 bandwidth is continually wasted by the user's having to steer (redundantly)
 into the coding regions.
