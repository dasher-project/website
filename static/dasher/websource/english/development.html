<h2>Development 2008</h2>
Here are some notes on the development of Dasher in 2008.
<br>
<h4>List of packages required to build Dasher for Gnome (From Peter Conlon.) </h4>
<pre>
Before building, I thought I had installed everything
listed in README in the dasher folder.

The first error was fixed by installing
libgconf2-dev

The following were then needed as I got a little further down automake:
libgtk2.0-dev   (perhaps I didn't have the -dev package initially)
libxtst-dev      (don't know what this is)
libgnome2-dev    (needed dev package)
libgnomeui-dev   (needed dev package)
libatspi-dev

It also complained about my version of gnome-doc-utils, 0.6.1 on
Debian/etch. Consequently, I had to upgrade to something bigger than 0.9,

So it seems I just didn't have the right -dev packages.

<h3>Work-arounds for annoying Dasher features</h3>
<pre>
 1. Solution to the nagging confirmation pop-up. We have a very talented
 amateur-programmer here on the Dasher Group. Himself being handicapped
 (although probably in a somewhat lesser degree) he's very resourceful
 and can customize his communication with the computer, so that it would
 require much less effort. I hope he gets in touch with you, because he
 could probably help you quite a bit more than I. His name is Andre Luiz
 dos Santos. You might have seen his postings to the group. Anyway, he
 works little miracles with a scripting language that is the key element
 of a little task-automating application called AutoHotKey. The miracle
 he worked for me is a tiny script that watches the system for the
 occurence of that particular pop-up and just auto-negates it for me. It
 works brilliant and saves me a bunch of totally useless, unnecessary
 clicks that really got on my nerves. You'll find the the script in the
 attachment. I believe the script should work for any Dasher version.
 Obviously, for the script to work you've got to install the AutoHotKey
 application first (here is the link:
 http://www.autohotkey.com/download/ ) After that all you need to do is
 to start the script (by double-clicking) -- once you install the
 application, the scripts' file extension "ahk" will be associated with
 it and double-clicking a script file will automatically start the
 AutoHotKey application and load the script into it. As far as I'm
 concerned I created a shortcut for the no-more-confirmation script and
 placed it in the AutoStart folder (to be found in menu Start->Programs).
 That way the script starts together with the system and I can cross the
 confirmation pop-up's problem from my mind for good.

<h4>Overview of Dasher status (email by DJCM)</h4>
[recap of some of Chris's main points:]
>> For the past few months, my frustration with recent versions of Dasher
>> had grown to the point where I was seriously considering trying to
>> rewrite large portions of it.
>> Many projects that are initiated by companies and
universities have difficulty working with outside developers.
>> I'd like to see a public mailing list for developers.
>> I'd like discussions about the
plans for Dasher to have a means for outside input.  Patches should be
posted to a list so they can be commented on, and improved.  Using git
for the version control would be nice.  Someone needs to go through
the bugs in Gnome's bugzilla.  New commits to the version control
should be well-described in the commit message, and should be small
and focused.  We need tests, and tests should pass before changes are
committed.  Normal, good development practices.  You know what I'm
talking about.  It's time to bring the development into the open.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

When we made Dasher open-source, our hope was that
many outside developers would get involved, and that by
now Dasher would be out of our hands, being looked after
by other people.

When I raised money to support a full-time Dasher developer
(a position which was funded for 5 years here in Cambridge),
the job description was very much along the lines suggested by Chris:
Normal, good development practices; involve users; do tests and make
sure all releases pass all tests; get other developers involved;
document everything.
I always wanted the development to be in the open and to have a tight
feedback loop with users and testers.  That's always been the
dream, but many of these desires haven't been realised.

The situation now is, having employed three Dasher developers
over those 5 years, we have now lost Phil Cowans to .com-land,
and the money has run out (at least until September 2008).

So Dasher is a drifting tanker with no engine, except for
us volunteers.  (The local volunteers in Cambridge Physics dept are
Keith Vertanen and David MacKay, and we still have occasional help from Phil
Cowans.)

Maybe in Sept 2008 we'll get a new engine fitted, and perhaps we
can do a better job of satisfying Chris's list. Until then, we
need a volunteer plan to handle the most urgent issues.

I suggest that a wiki and an email list will be the best way to
handle things.  One option is to simply use _this_ email list as the
forum for the volunteer crew to discuss things.
If there are any strong feelings that that would be a bad idea,
please email me so and I will sort out another email list.

I will send another email shortly with wiki coordinates.

thanks all, and sorry that there's not better service from Dasher Central
at present!

<h4>and From Phil Cowans</h4>
<pre>
Dear Chris and others,

Thanks for yor recent comments on Dasher. As you maybe know, I am no
longer able to devote more than a few hours a week to Dasher as it is no
longer part of my job. However, it does look like there may be enough
momentum here to keep the project alive as a community effort, so we
should try to make that happen and I should try to set things up so that
this can happen as easily as possible.

In terms of tools, we do have the standard set up (version control, bug
tracking etc.), but as development was largely done by me they weren't
generally used by the wider communty. If anyone does want to have access
to these then let me know and it can be arranged. I'll also try to take
stock of the various lists we have lying around and either repurpose one
as a development list or set up a new one so that people interested in
development have a place to talk. Please drop me a line if you'd like to
be on this list and let me know which email address to use.

Aside from that, there are a couple of points to be considered. Firstly,
someone needs to manage the release process - I can try to do that
myself, but I can't guarantee that I'll not run into problems due to my
time constraints, so if anyone is willing to take this on let me know
and I'll explain exactly what's involved.

Secondly, Chris is right that we need to focus on code quality rather
than new features. There is quite a long list of bugs in the database
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org/) which need to be confirmed, prioritised and
eventually fixed, and the code base does need to be thoroughly tested.
Basically there is a role for people who aren't in a position to
contribute code to help with testing and bug checking, so let me know if
you fall into that category.

Finally, if you are interested on working directly on the codebase, drop
me a line with a brief summary of what you expect to be able to
contribute and how much time you can spare, just so I have an idea of
where we stand in terms of resources.

---

[This message is being sent to the dasherteam Yahoo! group, but being
copied to dasher-text-entry as well. If you are not on the former yet,
but would like to be involved with the development process, let me know
and I'll add you to the list.]

As you may know Dasher does not currently have anyone working full time
on development. However, there is clearly a lot of demand from the user
community for bugfixes and new features, so it would be fantastic to
open the development process up to more community involvement. The
intention is to use this list (dasherteam@yahoogroups.com) to coordinate
development activities, so if anyone has any ideas for features, or is
interested in working on any particular aspect of Dasher then send a
message to the list. I have also created a wiki page on the GNOME Live!
site at http://live.gnome.org/Dasher, which might be useful for
prioritising work, keeping shared developer documentation and so on.

The source code for Dasher is in the GNOME Subversion repository, which
is located at http://svn.gnome.org/. The site includes instructions on
how to use Subversion for anyone who's not familiar with the system. To
have write access to the repository you need a GNOME account, but anyone
can check out the latest version of the code. I'd ideally like to get
people committing their changes directly as soon as possible, but to
start of with please submit patches either through the bug tracking
system or by email.

Bugs are tracked through the GNOME Bugzilla system, at
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/, under the product 'dasher'. I've just spent
some time cleaning up the bug listing, so things should be fairly up to
date and have the correct severities. I'd be very happy for anyone to
claim any of the bugs marked as new or unconfirmed - let me know if you
need your Bugzilla account permissions changed to be able to do this. If
you do take over any of the bugs, please assign them to yourself so that
others know that the issue is being worked on.

In terms of priorities, I think it would be good to first check the
unconfirmed bugs. These are mainly from the crash reporting system, so
there are probably a lot of duplicates. Having done that we should work
down the list in order of severity, and then start with the
enhancements. Something you may be interested in is that the GNOME
outreach programme is offering cash for people to fix accessibility
bugs, including several in Dasher - see
http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y/ for details.

One other issue is the roadmap and release process. It might be a good
idea to use the wiki to try and plan future development, including
target release dates and what's going to be included in each release.

Finally, if anyone has any ideas on how to encourage community
participation, I'd be very interested.

<h2>CVS branches 2005</h2>
<pre>
Gnome is going into feature freeze for its 2.12 release cycle from  
today; the release of Gnome 2.12.0 will be on September 7th.  This
means that we need to start preparing a CVS branch for that release,
and that string or UI changes to that branch will first need to be
announced, and later (after July 25th) need permission from the Gnome
release team.

Since we have some new release targets of our own, we'll be making
several CVS branches immediately:

dasher_3_2:  This branch will be for the 3.2 release that coincides
with DJCM's July 13th deadline and subsequent releases of 3.2.  (In
practise, we don't expect many more of those.  See below on HEAD.)

gnome-2-12:  This branch will be for the 3.2 release that freezes
immediately and is released with Gnome 2.12.0.  Bug fixes will be
applied, but not DJCM's eight proposed new features, and preferably
not string or UI changes unless necessary.  If they *are* necessary,
please let me know before committing them and I'll let the release
team know.

HEAD:  This branch will be for Dasher 4.0.0, which will contain a
heavily rewritten core, as proposed by Phil and Brian.

So.  Please commit the bugfixes that turn (what was until today)
"current HEAD" into a stable Dasher release to the gnome-2-12 and
dasher_3_2 branches, committing bugfixes to gnome-2-12 and bugfixes
plus new features to dasher_3_2.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<h3>Documentation for developers</h3>
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/pjc51/geometry.ps>Dasher Geometry and Dynamics</a>

<h3>Documentation for users who want to
    fiddle with the alphabets, colours, or training texts</h3>
    <h4>training text</h4>
    <p>
    We strongly encourage users to optimize the training text
    for their personal use.
    Dasher learns all the time as you write, and
    saves what it learns in a file
    (for example, all the writing of a linux user using English
     will be stored in a file  called
    <tt>~/.dasher/training_english_GB.txt</tt>).
 It is a great idea to take a load of text that is <em>like
  what you are going to write in the future</em>
  and put it into this file, or into
  the equivalent system-wide file
  (for example, <tt>/usr/local/share/dasher/training_english_GB.txt</tt>
  on a linux system).
  Next time Dasher is started, or next time you switch alphabet,
  both these files will be read so as to
  train the language model to make appropriate predictions.
  </p>
    <h4>colours</h4>
<p>    Users can configure the colours used by Dasher.
    Dasher uses 242 colours at any one time.
    How those colours are defined and used
    is specified by two files,
    the alphabet file
    <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.englishC.xml>(Example)</a>
    and
    the colour file
    <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/colour.euroasian.xml>(example)</a>.
    Both these XML files are plain text files that you can edit.
    The alphabet file specifies by numbers between 1 and 242
    which colours each letter and group in the alphabet should have.
    The colour file defines what those 242 colours actually are. 
</p><p>
 Version 4 of Dasher offers several colour schemes to choose among.
 Many of our alphabets use a colour scheme (a 'palette') called <tt>European/Asian</tt>.
    Here's how the default colours work for European languages.
 The     GROUPS are coloured like this:
 <ul>
 <li>
  accents and marks - ORANGE (colour number 51)
 </li>
 <li>lower case characters - this group is not coloured
 </li>
 <li>upper case characters - YELLOW (colour number 111)
 </li>
  <li>numerals - RED (colour 113)
 </li>
 <li>punctuation - DARK GREEN (colour 112)
 </li>
 <li>space character and newline - WHITE (not actually a group)
 </li>

 </ul>

<h3>Notes on the new subroutines added to Dasher for button mode</h3>
Mon 9/8/04
 <p>
 The core zooming function of regular Dasher
 involves the following sequence of subroutines[in files shown]
 <pre>
 TapOn[DasherInterface]
   -> TapOnDisplay [DasherViewSquare]
      -> Tap_on_display[DasherModel]
   -> Render
	DrawMouse
	Display
   -> NewFrame 
 </pre>
 With the new button modes, we mimic the above sequence by calling
 <pre>
 GoTo[DasherInterface]
                                 which calls
 MultiStepGoTo[DasherInterface]
   -> PlanGoTo [DasherViewSquare]
       -> PlanGoTo [DasherModel]
   Loop through iSteps{
   -> StepGoTo [DasherViewSquare]
       -> NewGoTo [DasherModel]
   -> Render
   -> Display
   }
   -> FinalGoTo [DasherViewSquare]
       -> NewGoTo [DasherModel]
   -> Render
   -> Display
 </pre>
 
 </p>
 <h3>More notes on static one-button mode</h3>
<p>
 It is important that we exploit the full accuracy
of the user's click timing. It is very likely that
their accuracy is similar to, or possibly even smaller
than, the time between successive renderings of the
falling pointer.
It's thus essential, I think, that we keep track of the
actual TIME of the click event, relative to the last
rendering time, in order to get SUPERRESOLUTION of
the mousey coordinate.
</p><p>
So the code should look something like this:
<pre>
set pointer coordinate
render the pointer at y1
note the time t1
decide where the next pointer will be rendered y2, and
estimate the time t2 at which that will happen

IF ( click event happens )
        Note time t at which click event happened
        Define
                y = (t-t1) * y2 + (t2-t) * y1
                    -------------------------
                            t2-t1
			    
        Initiate zoom in on location y.


                (Special case event handling:
                if t>t2, declare t=t2, before doing the y formula;
                and if a click occurs before we have rendered the first
                pointer at y1=CANVAS_TOP, declare y=CANVAS_TOP)
</pre>

</p>
<p>
<b> During a zoom:</b>
  When the above computation of "y" has occurred, I think it will
 be very helpful to the user to see visualized on the screen a
 splat mark that shows WHERE Y WAS. That way, they will learn
 whether they clicked earlier or later than they intended.
 I think a good way to do this will be to create a new routine
 called  draw_splat_at_dasher_coordinate_y(dashery) .
</p><p>
 The way this will work is:
        when the zoom is initiated, my GoTo routine, which
 receives dashery (which has been put through screen2dasher)
 remembers that dashery value, and, every time it does a Render
 and Display, it will also Draw a splat object (which should
be an object that looks just like the pointer arrow object, except
maybe it could have a different colour, like red) at that
dashery coordinate (appropriately mapped through dasher2screen).
Because a zoom is busy happening, the
splat object won't be rendered at the same canvas y coordinate
as the click happened - indeed, during the zoom, it will be
rendered at a sequency of positions that drift to the CENTRE
of the screen, because of the zoom being a zoom-in-on y.
</p><p>

I'd like there to be two objects, a splat object
that GoTo knows about and renders, and the regular bouncing pointer, which
is not rendered during the zoom event (or else is rendered at
CANVAS_TOP during every frame of the zoom), and which is another piece
of code's responsiblity.
The regular bouncing pointer should be reset to CANVAS_TOP
when the zoom event is started.

 </p><div width=80%>
 <p>
Rules to mark the tone for Pinyin:
<ol><li>
 if there are more than
one vowels and the first one is 'i', 'u' or '&#252;', then the second vowel
takes the mark;
</li><li>
 Otherwise,the first vowel takes the mark. (the vowels in
Pinyin: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', '&#252;' )
</li></ol>

By the way, there are several small tricks in writing Pinyin, e.g. "Hanyu
Pinyin" simplifies the spellings of syllables with '&#252;' by using the 'u' form
instead in cases where no ambiguity could result, for example when '&#252;'
comes after 'j', 'q', 'x' or 'y' . This is merely a spelling convention;
the 'u's here are still pronounced '&#252;'".
</p><p>
For a detailed guide to the rules of Pinyin,please refer to the following
webpages (in English) Combinations of initials and finals
(http://www.pinyin.info/rules/initials_finals.html) Where do the tone marks
go? (http://www.pinyin.info/rules/where.html) Basic Rules of Hanyu Pinyin
Orthography (http://www.pinyin.info/readings/zyg/rules.html)
</p><p>

Software: Here are some free and popular input methods in Linux. I guess
they may contain the source codes to convert Pinyin to Chinese characters.
1.SICM: http://www.scim-im.org/ (Input methods include
(Simplified/Traditional) Chinese, Japanese, Korean and many European
languages) 2.Fcitx: http://www.fcitx.org/main/ (In English:

</p>
<p>
<a href=http://www.newhua.com.cn/soft/16989.htm>a software which can translate Chinese character 
 to Pinyin is useful to create training data? If so, the following

FoldingPage Japanese alphabets
<h2>Japanese alphabets</h2>
Thu 22/7/04.
<div align=right><a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/images/japanese/Jouyou.html>New screen-shots</a></div>
<p>
 For the last two years, our only Japanese alphabets have been
 <a href="/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.hiragana.xml>Hiragana60 and Hiragana83</a>.
 </p><p>
 With the help of Simon Cozens,
 we have now added some more alphabets.
 <ul>
 <li>The first, 
 <a href="/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.Japanese.xml>alphabet.Japanese.xml</a>,
 includes 7000 Kanji sorted into an order recommended on an
 alphabetization webpage.
 We also have hiragana, katakana, and roman numerals.
 
 </li><li>The second, 
 <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.Joyo.xml">in alphabet.Joyo.xml</a>,
 has about 1900 Kanji grouped into 9 levels, in the order that they
 are taught at school.
 </li><li>
<a href= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.Joyo.xml>in alphabet.Joyo.xml</a>
 has the same Kanji grouped into 83 groups on the
 basis of a possible `first Hiragana character'.
 </li><li>
 The final grouping
 <a href= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.Joyo.xml>in alphabet.Joyo.xml</a>
 is based on the RADICALS. Every Kanji has a unique
 radical (as used in Kanji dictionaries). The radicals are sorted
 in dictionary order (by number of strokes).
 Within a radical the Kanji are put in dictionary order; hopefully
 few enough of them that the user can find the Kanji.
 </li>
 </ul>
 
</p><p>
On Tue 10/8/04 I added several more punctuation characters, including
middle-dot and Japanese comma, 
plus lower and upper case
 romaji to the    <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.Joyo.xml">alphabet.Joyo.xml</a> alphabets.

 A full list of  punctuation characters can be seen <a href=
"http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/punctuation.xml">in punctuation.xml</a>.

FoldingPage Notes from March 2005
<h2>Dasher meeting Fri 25/3/05</h2>
<h3>Progress reports</h3>
<h4>Phil</h4>
 Phil is implementing several new language models. At present
 these are stand-alone models for evaluation, not yet integrated
 into Dasher. No new model has yet been found that beats standard ppm by more than
 5%.
 <br>
 
 New models include models that use recent words as context, and
 models that ignore context further back than the most recent word-boundary
 (i.e. like Martin King's T9).
 <br>
 Phil has added bit-rate instrumentation. 

 <h4>Keith</h4>
 Speech Dasher is working with Dragon.
 <br>
  A new button allows the user to confirm the whole utterance best guess is correct. (Suggested
  including a dwell-based solution to this task, for people who can't click.)
 <br>
 Code is instrumented and ready for user trials.

 <h4>David M</h4>
 Most Alphabet files are now believed to be correct.
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/images/arabic.png>
 Arabic</a>
  works nicely including cursive writing in text boxes.
<br>
 <img src=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/ClearlyU.gif align=right>
  <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/unicode.html>Combining accents</a>
  are  also working well in some linux fonts, but not all. (Which shows, I think,
  that we have done it right; it's a font defect.)
  For the time being all our european languages use the "composed" form (ie we do not
  use combining accents), but from time to time we should revisit this
  issue and ask europeans whether they would prefer to
  use combining accents.
  In anticipation, 
  I have created a single 
  <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/download/alphabets/alphabet.latin.xml>latin
  ISO-8859 alphabet</a>
 in   which <b>every</b> latin language can be written.

 <h4>Chris</h4>
 Groups and subgroups were completed in November 2004 but do not work
 with Kaburagi's Japanese groups.
 <br>
 <h5>Button modes</h5>
 There is a working  One button static mode (i.e. click when pointer is in correct location).
 There are working N-button direct, and 2-button menu-modes. "Click mode" should be
 ready too.
 <br>
 Bugs include
 <ul>
 <li>
 problems when the user backs up rapidly
 </li>
 <li>
 Static One Button mode not yet test-ready because we need <em>Interpolation</em>
 and <em>time correction</em> (eg subtract 100ms).
 </li>
 <li>
 these new modes do not yet all work in a single dasher executable.
 </li>
 </ul>
 
 One-button dynamic mode (metronome mode) exists but is not currently integrated.
 Chris has invented another one-button dynamic mode in which Dasher zooms
 steadily and relatively slowly towards the point top right in the Canvas; this means
 that the desired target will at some point fall off the bottom of the screen; the user
 clicks when the desired target enters a red zone.
 Clicking causes a (two-button-direct-like) zoom in on the red zone.
 A second button is used to stop. That stop button could also be used to
 back up (reverse).

 <h5>Ingrid</h5>
 Ingrid is testing  N-button direct, and 2-button menu-modes.

<h3>Language model issues</h3>
<ol><li>
 Would be nice to include <b>recency</b>.
 Possible way to handle this is to maintain two tries, one with the bulk of the corpus in
 it and one with say the last 1000 characters.  Ideally a componential model or mixture model
 would be used, which would identify which of the experts are contributing best to
 the current predictions.
 </li><li>
  At what time should the ppm language model <em>learn</em>?
  Should we bother making individual nodes have slightly different
  language models from each other? (I think not, since it only
  makes a big difference for completely untrained models.)
 </li><li>
 Idea: identify a special character that has the meaning "reset the
 context at this point". This would be used in training texts
 that include lists of unrelated phrases or unrelated words (eg dictionary lists).
 </li><li>
 Storage of the learned trie direct to file, and reading of trie instead of
 reading and retraining. (The first two bytes in this stored structure could
 define the language protocol, so that new language models can be added.)
 </li><li>
 A dictionary based T9 like language model: would it go faster if we changed
 from storing the dictionary using hashes to using a trie?
 </li><li>
 Is user speed well predicted by "just bits"?
 Experiment to test this:  log an expert user's x-coordinate.
 </li><li>
 Possible new parameters to replace "smoothing" (5%):
 Maximum permitted character size (eg 90%), and Smoothing (eg 2%). (Mick Donegan's request)
 </li>
 </ol>

<h3>Steering issues</h3>
<ol><li>
Automatic speed control.
Hopefully a  student called Chris will work on this
during the Summer.
 </li><li>
 TILT SENSOR. We have received a loan of a tilt-driven hand-held mouse.
 The mouse does not work!
 <b>Would make a grand summer project for a student</b>
 </li><li>
  Oliver Williams from CUED gave a great talk demonstrating
  live, video-driven use of dasher by simple gestures (eg hand motion).
  Should be easy for him to make a free nose tracker too.
 </li><li>
  Singing/humming as one-dimensional input: Keith will do.
 </li><li>
 Button experiments: direct and menu both under way (Ingrid).
 Other button modes need to be tested too. What buttons should we use?
 Pswitch? ACE centre switches? (Both have latency/delay problems for
 fast users.)   Could make out own modified keyboard. 
 </li><li>
  Can we/Ryan/Oliver make video-based switch events (eg eyebrow raised)?
 </li><li>
  Add breath signal to breath dasher to ensure that the user is forced to breath.
 </li><li>
  Eyetracker: would be nice to have one that works in linux.
  headmouse: ditto. (<b>possible project for expert programmer</b>)
 </li><li>
 Brain Computer Interface? DJCM might go to a meeting in June.
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Platform issues, useability, integration</h3>
<ol><li>
 We need a meeting with DJW to discuss tablet pc, pocket pc, and .net
 </li><li>
 Palm pilot is a challenging platform to work on - difficult to find a volunteer
 developer, but perhaps if money were available we could pay someone to
 handle the port. Chris will send out an email.
 </li><li>
 Mac and Windows will in due course require a little bit of work to
 add (1) button dasher dialogs; (2) language model dialogs.
 </li><li>
 We discussed the idea of generating the source code for the dialog windows automatically
 from a single universal specification. 
 </li><li>
 We discussed whether using the gconf file of gnome and the registry of windows
 is the best way to store the user's dasher settings.  Doing it ourselves with
 values stored in a dasherrc file feels simpler; but it was agreed to continue
 with the registry approach.
 </li><li>
 Integration of Dasher as an input mode.<br>
  Difficult  in windows because the desired accessibility features
  are not present.
  <br>
  Talk to GOK people about getting Dasher integrated as input mode in Gnome.
  <b>A good task for an expert programmer to be dedicated to</b>
  <br>
  Windows (tablet pc) - is there  a problem with the (keyboard-shaped!) geometry of the area
  allowed for an input method?
 </li><li>
  To discuss further:
  <br> Dasher's control mode menus, speech production, and driving of other
  computer functions, eg scripts, from within Dasher.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Japanese</h3>
<ol>
<li>
  Possible idea is to get Kaburagi and Frederik (from Caltech)
  to work together on making the new language model that's needed.
 </li><li>
 Hopefully we could get Martin King's colleague Cliff (Japanese T9 expert)
 to advise us too.
 </li><li>
  We await the results of Itoh's gaze experiments with interest.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>COGAIN</h3>
<ol>
<li>
  We will go to the language modelling camp
  on Sat 28 May or Sun 29th and come back on Friday 3rd June, evening.
   We get to give about 3 hrs of presentations
  about language models and Dasher.
 </li><li>
 Tobii eyetracking company are interested in integrating Dasher with their
 system, but are they going to do the required work? (Seems like they would
 like us to, but we are too busy at present.)
 </li><li>
 Cogain funding has been used to send Ryan to interact with Tobi Delbruck.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Future projects</h3>

<ol>
<li>Tasks for undergraduate projects:
<ul>
 <li> Automatic speed control - Chris
 </li><li> Automatic eyetracker callibration (more than one scalar) - Chris 
 </li><li> Button Dasher
 </li><li> Tilt Dasher
 </li>
 </ul>
 
 </li><li>
  Tasks for professionals
<ul>
 <li>  Interface design, polishing. Get expert advice on enhancing useability.  
 </li><li>
<b> basher</b> (ie the shell in which writing of commands and filenames is all done in Dasher style)
 [Luke is working on source-code-writing]
 </li><li>
<b>  Get Dasher working on Playstation 2</b>. With the aim being to get it
 used on all those new handheld PS machines. Good for publicity. 
 </li><li>
  Make Dasher a fully-integrated input method for tablet pc; for pocket pc.
 </li><li>
<b>  Use of Dasher for non-writing tasks</b>.
 searching for a string in a document, or in MANY documents. (eg in all your files 
 (like <tt>glimpse</tt> or  <tt>Beagle</tt>))
 <br>
 The idea being that the interface would show you which strings are legal and allow you
 to write them  quickly.  Requires google-like indexing of all the data.
 <li> Peano Dasher
 </li>
 </ul>
 
 </li><li>
 Tasks for us to do:
<ul>
 <li> Get scripts built into the control mode menus
 </li><li>
<b>  Japanese project (as above) </b> - make special language model
 </li><li>
<b>Chinese project  </b>

 We probably  need a similar special language model for Chinese; at present we have no
 active developers or researchers helping us.
 </li>
 </ul>

 </li>
</ol>

Bug list:
<ul><li>
 Should be able to back up as far as you want.
 </li><li>
 Visualize  Cursor in text box at all times.
 </li><li>
 Focus problem (need to get focus back to canvas).
</li><li>
From DJW: <br>
The main thing making it difficult to integrate new langugage models into
Dasher (or improving existing ones) is having all the control-node code  
inside the current PPM model.  Another problem i recall is having the
control-node characters added to the alphabet.

I think a bit of re-design is necessary to decouple stuff like this.

</ul>

FoldingPage Version 3.0.2 Release Notes
<pre>
I've just released version 3.0.2 of Dasher, which can be downloaded from
<a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Download.html>
http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Download.html </a>

This version should fix the bugs related to zooming at the top and
bottom of the canvas, and also introduces a keyboard control method
using the up, down and left cursor keys. This is intended for people
using switch input, but may be useful for other purposes.

Unix users have a new GTK2 interface, which will be compiled
automatically if GTKMM is unavailable or if the --with-gtk2 option is
passed to ./configure. There's an RPM of the GTK2 version, which should
make life easier for people who've had problems satisfying GTKMM
dependencies in the past.

Developers should note the introduction of a (mostly) C layer that
interfaces between the interface and the C++ core. At the moment this
still contains some vestigal C++ code, but in future it should be
possible to write Dasher interface code in C rather than C++ if desired.
Thanks to Phil Cowens for contributing this code.

FoldingPage Version 3.0.1 Release Notes
Tue 18/3/03
<h3>Version 3.0.1 Release Notes</h3>
<p>
The main aims in this release were to deal with obvious bugs and provide
various features to support disabled users. The one dimensional input
mode may also prove interesting to other users - it may take a small
amount of time to get used to it, but you may also find it easier than
the traditional two dimensional input.
</p><p>
This version should be considered a fairly good basis for porting to
other platforms. I've added an experimental GTK2 interface to the source
tree - it works, but most features aren't implemented yet. It's probably
a better example for anyone who isn't familiar with GTKMM or Win32 code.
</p><p>
<pre>
What's changed:

General:
Default alphabet reordered
API documentation added
Font size changeable
Interfaces now use a crosshair within the Dasher canvas
Flicker reduced
One dimensional input mode introduced
Logical position of the mouse pointer can be displayed  
All settings should now be saved between runs
Various fixes to improve prediction

Windows:
Windows version can be started and stopped using the space bar rather
than themouse
Fixed Windows file operations
Import training file should now work
Fix handling of rapid mouse clicks

Unix:
GTK version gettextised for ease of translation
Added experimental GTK2 version

FoldingPage Notes from 12/02
<h3>December 2002 - AGENDA</h3>

<h5>Wish list</h5>
<pre>
1) The colour scheme and alphabet are pretty intimately related,
   so a possible method would be to have the alphabet 
        file be turned into an augmented file that 
        specifies the alphabet and the colours too. 

2) But that seems a bad idea because it means that every 
        time a new english alphabet is made, four copies
        of ti have to be made, one for each of the four standard
        colour schemes (say).

        And the way in which (alphabet1,colourscheme1)
        differs from         (alphabet1,colourscheme2)
        will probably have a lot in common with 
        how                  (alphabet2,col1)
        differs from         (alphabet2,col2)

3) So we think that a componential scheme is desirable, 
        consisting of three components.

Component 1:     a list of the letters of the alphabet.

Component 2:  an allocation of those letters to 
                "colour integers".

Component 3:  a mapping of those colour integers
                to a PAIR of actual colours (one for each 
                of the levels in the DJW alternation of two
                colour sets)

Colour integers could be anything from 0 to 127, 
then the total number of colours used by Dasher would be at most 
256. 

Does this sound a sensible plan?

The idea then is that component 2 could be constructed with 
some logical categories in mind; then any component 3 can 
respect those logical categories easily.  

Examples of requested colour schemes include

a) virtually monochrome
b) very bleached colours
c) reverse video:   white chars on blackish backgrounds
d) blue on yellow 
e) yellow on blue


XML suggestion
I suggest that the header in the XML file for 
alphabets be made a bit more informative.

instead of saying " This file was created by blah "

it should also say

"This file is read by Dasher version 3;
it may be edited by the user to change the alphabet"

or 

"This file is read by Dasher version 3;
it should not be edited directly; rather, you should edit
the widg.blah file and then run foo to re-generqate this file"

----

The help file in Dasher 300 is out of date and has 
a few minor errors in it.

</pre>

<h5>Notes arising from last meeting</h5>
 At last dasher meeting we agreed to make a non-coll machine
 be the CVS server - A devoted dasher machine.
 However, at group meeting we decided to stick with coll
 being the CVS server because:
 1) coll already set up for this role.
 2) we do not wish to allow non-group users to have access
 to the dasher code for the next 3-6 months anyway,
 so there is no additional security risk.

 When the time comes to open up CVS access to anyone who
 wants to tinker, the CVS tree should be moving to another
 machine anyway.

 
<h4>Thoughts for next meeting</h4>

<h5>Management priorities</h5>
<ol>
<li> 
 Establish management system to handle code contributions
  for multiple platforms and multiple languages.
</li>
<li>
 Establish management system to handle CORPUS contributions
  for multiple languages.
</li>
<li>
 Establish  system for making automated releases
  for all platforms and languages. 
</li>
<li>
 Establish system for testing new releases (multiple volunteers to be
 notified and report back)
</li>
<li>
 Get MacOS volunteer on the job of making the first Dasher for Mac.
</li>
<li>
 Establish communication with lots of users.
 Ensure metafaq and bugzilla working well for handling
 feedback from different types of users.
 Establish on-line wish-lists and on-line bug lists,
 perhaps organised in part by user-category. Disabled users on all platforms;
 windows lists; linux lists; ipaq lists;  and general?
</li>
<li>
 Get a palmOS volunteer, playstation, etc.
</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>
</li>
</ol>



<h5>Bug list</h5>

<ol>
<li> Win95 (rum): mouse flickers while dasher is going, so that
	often one can't see where the mouse is. Desire mouse to
	be continuously visible. Does this happen on other win95 systems?
	 [Problem does not exist in win2k]
</li>
<li>
  Win2000 version starts with a silly fourth alphabet called "?" which
 contains no letters. (Is this true only on "polluted" systems?)
</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>
</li>
</ol>

<h5>High-priority Feature request list</h5>
<ol>
<li>
 NUMERALS! 0123456789.
 <br>
 Please could these be added to the "lots of punctuation" alphabet
  in all platforms. For consistency with version 2, put numerals in a red box
  and punctuation in a green box.
</li>
<li>
	When insertion point is defined, have the language model
	push right the way down to smallest square size, rather
	 than only showing the first letters.
</li>
<li> Have option to make "space-bar" cause start'n'stop as well
      as mouse button.
       And have option to DISABLE the mouse button, so that it does NOT
       start and stop. This is important, as many excited  users unthinkingly
       click the button for no good reason.
</li>
<li> Allow user to change font size - imagine a special needs person
 with bad eyesight!
</li>
<li>
 Make reverseable history larger, so the user can
 back up the last word or two.
</li>
<li> Make the two types of  nonlinearity
      adjustable (by experts). [Call them the <b>screen
       nonlinearity</b>, which controls the squishing of the
       rendering at the top and the bottom, and the <b>mouse
       nonlinearity</b>, which at present remaps the effective
       mouse coordinate to be a little more vertically extreme than the
       true mouse coordinate.]
</li>
<li>
 Modify the default mouse nonlinearity to be the one suggested
 by DJCM, which slightly slows the expansion when
 the mouse is near the top or bottom. (See DJCM for details)
</li>
<li>
 Develop a new mouse nonlinearity aimed at users with only
 one dimension of control. Extreme input coordinates get mapped to
 "zoom out and drift up" and 
 "zoom out and drift down".
</li>
<li>
 Investigate mild tweaks to the screen nonlinearity so that
 better use is made of real-estate.  A more logarithmic transformation,
 kicking in a little to the right of the cross-hair.
</li>
<li> Windows: should Dasher use the "registry"? Doing this means
  that how Dasher version 3.1.4 behaves will depend on
  what other versions of Dasher have been installed in the
  past. This makes user support and bug reporting and
  bug fixing more complicated.

  Yes, it's wasteful to have a new installation create a
  load of identical files. But I think it's the right way to do
  things.  But what do I know?
</li>
</ol>

<h5>Low-priority Feature request list</h5>

<ol>
<li>
	Have checkbox "Save Dasher settings on exit",
	so that you can lend Dasher to a friend, let them fool
	around trying out portuguese, or whatever, and then just quit it.
	Or alternatively have a dialog at exit time that says
	"save settings? (y/n)".
</li>
<li>	Have a "revert settings to what they were at the beginning
	of this session" option.
</li>
<li> Windows: show the insertion point at all times, so that
 the user can tell where the text is going to appear when
  they use Dasher.
</li>
 <li>
 In addition to  the "copy all" option (f5), have a "cut all" option (f6?).
 This would be useful to people who are using Dasher to talk.
 They don't want the text to be there any more, once they have spoken.
 "Cut all" should cut everything to the clipboard. 
</li>
<li> Colour scheme:
	should we make it consistent with version 2:
	there, the punctuation chars are in a green box and the numerals
	are in a red box.
</li>
 <li> Alphabet with Pound and Euro symbol.
 </li>
<li> Win95 (rum): Font selection dialogue to have "Apply" button as
 well as OK button, so that the user can interactively try alternative
 fonts.
</li>
<li> Windows: font selection dialogue to clarify the (lack of) role for
     the size option. (Or better, allow the size to be changed!)
</li>
<li> Windows: Alphabet dialogue box - the box is not very clear,
 it seems to me. Should the user click on the alphabet they want?
 Or should they click "New". Or both?  Is it possible to have
 explanatory text hover next to each button?
</li>
<li> Win95 (rum): Alphabet  selection dialogue to have "Apply" button as
 well as OK button, so that the user can interactively try alternative
 alphabets.
 </li>
 <li>
  Double-click in the alphabet selection should be equivalent
  to selecting and clicking OK.
 </li>

<h3>27 November 2002</h3>
<p>
 Dasher  3.0.0 preview 2 is now ready for release on both windows
 and linux. (Windows 2000 is fine, win 95 not checked yet.)
  Releases are being bundled today and hopefully will
 be linked to the website this week.
 Default location for releases will be at
 www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/platformname/versionnumber
 
  </p>
  <p>
  Please send <abbr title="A URL is One of those internet addresses like http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk">URL</abbr>s to DJCM when ready.
  </p>
  <p>
  The character/square over-writing problem has been solved.
  </p>
  <p>
Minor bugs remaining are:
<ol>
<li> Cut and paste buttons are missing from the windows version,
	though cut and paste functionality is fine.
</li>
<li> When a selection is made in the text box of the windows version,
	the language model is incorrectly initialized to the
	right of the selection where it should always
	be the LEFT of the selection. [Now fixed, Wed 27/11/02.]
</li>
</ol>
  </p>
  <p>
  MJG will have more time for Dasher from Dec 9th 2002.
  </p>
  <p>

  Regular Dasher meetings will happen Wednesdays at 10.15am.
  </p>
  <p>
	MJG has got Dasher working (nearly) in WINElib so that
windows	development is possible in a linux environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Dasher job has been advertised and the closing date is this Friday.
  </p>
  <p> Demonstration
   non-english languages are not yet in 3.0.0;
   Phil will find out standard portuguese alphabetical order from a friend.
<b>   lccollate</b> also offers information on alphabetical orders.
  </p>
  <p> The master CVS will be moved from sourceforge back to local machines
  shortly.
  </p>
  <p> A dedicated old linux machine will be used to run dasher CVS
  and bugzilla services. Hanna will set up Bugzilla. Phil will select the right machine.

  Bugzilla should be laoded up with sourceforge bug lists
  and with old bug lists from
  /home/mackay/dasher/incoming/bugzilla
  and with this:
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=481717&group_id=56761&func=browse

  </p>
  <p> Copyright: Code written by Phil is (c) Phil for the time being.
  Donors outside the group are asked to transfer copyright to the (c) owner
  of the file they modified, or transfer it to MJG.
  </p>
  <p> Hanna will have version 3 for linux ipaq packaged soon.
  </p>
  <p> MJG recommends buying dasher.org.uk for two years,
  and having cvs.dasher.org.uk redirect to
  mull.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk (or whatever the machine will be)
  because cvs.dasher.org.uk is easier to type than
  mull.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk.
  </p>
  <p>
</p>
<h3>19 November 2002</h3>
<p>
Good progress is being made on creating Dasher 3.0.0 pre-release
for both GNU/linux and ipaq-running-linux.
</p>
<p>
The procedure for installing linux 300 from sourceforge is
</p>

<pre>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.dasher.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dasher login
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.dasher.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dasher co dasher3
  cd dasher3
  ls
  aclocal
  autoconf
  automake
  ./configure
  make
  make install
</pre>

<p>
 Hanna is working on the port of Dasher 3 to the ipaq-running-linux
  and is also planning to work on "dash", the dasher command shell.

<h3>
Notes from Dasher Meeting held 19th Oct 2002 in Darwin College
</h3>
<pre>
Present: David MacKay (djcm), Phil Cowans (pjc),
	 Iain Murray (iam), Matthew Garrett (mjg)

Priorities from the point of view of iam

1. Standardise / stabilise core - review design first (mjg to do this)
2. Desired release types:
   (a) Windows - installer .exe
   (b) Linux - GTK ok, but not necessarily gnome
               Would like .deb, .rpm and .tar.gz at least, with
	       minimal dependencies.
3. Documentation, comments, explaining everything to mjg &c.
4. Rearrange CVS structure to make internal/external interface
   differentiation clear
5. Need detailed specifcation for the core 
6. Finalise splitting/combining rules etc. for unicode accent marks

Possible functions to be included in future versions:

(a) Dasher core 
    (*) Control menu character - like esc in vi, appearing before 'a'
    and containing things like 'oops', 'stop', other menu optons
    (speak &c.)
    (*) Core support for one-dimensional version (possibly just a
    mapping to an effective cursor position)
    (*) [Support for hiding passwords?]
    (*) Piping to other apps (such as speech synthesizer) - should be
    accessible through control character
    (*) Embedding / better interaction with other apps (ActiveX,
    Bonobo etc.)
    (*) Capability to include foreign chracters in text
    (*) Identify and reject stupid (eg pdf) training files (eg if more
    than 10% of characters end up being ignored) (also, how should one
    deal with the odd foreign character in the training file, eg an
    umlaut on the word naive?)
    (*) Multithreading to enable training in background
    (*) Port for palm, psion etc.

(b) UI tweaks

    (*) Combining / unicde conversion etc. to be finalised - There are
    three possible ways of doing this:

      (i) Force minimal expansion (one char per glyph)
      (ii) Allow standard expansions, to be handled by a standard 
      library
      (iii) Allow custom combination rules (hard to implement)

    It was decided that implementing (i) and (ii) was a sensible
    compromise.

    (*) Support to guess alphabet from locale etc.
    (*) Colours - user confgurations, also assigning specific colours
    to specific symbols.

Plan for the future:

1. Get 3.0rc1 out the door for Win NT, Win 9x, Linux, Mac etc.
   (a) WinNT right away
   (b) Linux - need alphabet/settings etc., but possibly relatively soon
   (c) 9x later 
   (d) Give source to mac os person   
   And then work towards full 3.0 release based on peoples comments,
   maybe at the end of November.

2. 3.1 has control mode (+ continue with bugfixes etc.), gtk v2.0 in Linux

Languages can be added along the way

--
Further notes added by DJCM Mon 21/10/02

The new eyetracker was installed on S's win98 machine by Phil today.
Dasher works pretty well at 70cm. No recallibration was necessary
between uses. The lens focal length is too short for
satisfactory use at a range of 100cm. I have asked Eyetech whether
we can get a longer focal-length lens. A first run with S may
take place on Wednesday. An important issue is the creation of
an appropriate button-driven control for starting and stopping Dasher.

<pre>
I've started uploading stuff to CVS on sourceforge.
To save you some time, here is some info to get you started. Its all documented
at sourceforge.

You can browse CVS on the web here:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dasher/

There seem to be 2 shell accounts - but I think they both map
to the same home space. I think that only the second will allow access
to the Dasher website.

ssh username@shell.sourceforge.net
ssh username@dasher.sourceforge.net

To get passwordless access to the shell accounts, do the
usual thing of uploding your .ssh public key to .ssh/authorised_keys on
sourceforge.

The CVS respository is here:
cvs.dasher.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dasher

You should be able to ssh to it to test it. To get passwordless
ssh access to CVS, you have to upload your ssh public key via the
web interface (go to account maintenance). It takes six hours for the public key to go live.

I seem to have everything working smoothly now without passwords
(with WinCVS 1.3.6 and ssh1.2.14 for Win32). Let me know if you
have any questions.

Only 'Developers/Admins' can check in stuff. That list is currenly

FoldingPage Dasher Plan 07/02

<h1>Dasher meeting 10/07/2002</h1>

<em>These notes are based on discussions between David MacKay
(DJCM), Phil Cowans (PJC) and Iain Murray (IAM).</em> 

<h2>Management of the Project</h2>

<h3>Quick Note on Development</h3>

<p>IAM will be developing Dasher full time for the next ~2 months
until mid-September 2002. DJCM is looking into support for the
project beyond that. The commitment required will depend on the
amount of help we can obtain from the Open Source community, though
we probably want someone in the group to manage the project.</p>

<h3>First Target</h3>

<p>IAM will address the most pressing needs of Dasher 2.x. For
example the zoom-rate of the Dasher interface needs to be
controllable rather than a constant. Some other parts of the user
interface needs attention, but it must be kept simple to use. Once
DJCM is happy that the current source tree is usable and license
issues are sorted out we can make our first release on Sourceforge.
By this stage we have not necessarily finalised the class
interfaces. Therefore we must emphasise that people should not rush
into building ports around this version, but instead ask for
comments and bug reports. DJCM will email people that have
expressed interest in Dasher in the past about this release. The
source to 1.6.8 could be released at the same time.</p>

<h3>Sourceforge</h3>

<p>The advantages of using <a href=
"http://www.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> are apparent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Well integrated project management with file distribution,
bug-tracking, source-tree and other features.</li>

<li>They know how to set up a read-only CVS server for use by all
in a secure way better than we do.</li>

<li>Bug tracking can move to there if it is as good as our current
Bugzilla setup. <em>This needs investigating.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, for the moment Sourceforge is unfamiliar and IAM is not
ready to interact with other contributers yet. We will continue to
use CVS on coll. DJCM, PJC, IAM and DJW will have write access. The
rest of the group will have read access. Until the CVS is moved to
Sourceforge we will have to provide regular archives of the source
so that any contributed diff's will be useful.</p>

<h3>Second Target</h3>

<p>After the initial release IAM will work through his TODO list
(coll:~iam23/Dasher2do.txt), which is based largely on <a href=
"http://sparkltd.com/bugs">Bugzilla</a> and the <a href=
"http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/todo.html">Dasher
site</a>. It is desirable to make the code completely Windows
independent. Ideally a Dasher library could be used by any
application on any system.</p>

<p>We would like to publicise Dasher as widely as possible. Perhaps
on <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> and <a href=
"http://freshmeat.net/">FreshMeat</a>. We are likely to get the
best response from these audiences if an up-to-date Linux version
is available.</p>

<h3>Cross-Platform Interface</h3>

<p>IAM will look seriously at producing an interface to a Dasher
library using <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">wxwindows</a>.
This is a set of C++ libraries that could allow easy support for
Windows, Mac and UNIX simultaneously. The Pocket PC version should
be addressed too.</p>

<h3>Adaption Rule</h3>

<p>If IAM has time he will look into a new approach for updating
the zoom-rate of the interface.</p>

<hr>
<h2>License Issues</h2>

<p>Currently we have no plans to trademark the name Dasher. The
license and copyright notices attached to the Dasher source-code
are still undecided. Features of the required license include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perpetual free use of Dasher and all "derived" versions for the
group, all academics. Ideally individuals and commercial bodies
would have these rights as well.</li>

<li>Sale and resale should be allowed to enable (for example) use
by companies providing a bundled computer package for the support
of disabled people.</li>

<li>It should be clear where the software has come from and a
donation to the University of Cambridge suggested.</li>
</ul>

<p>Discussions so far have centred around the GNU General Public
License, the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>, and its Lesser
variant, the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a>. A <a href=
"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD-style
license</a> was rejected as it does not ensure derivatives make
their way back to the group. At the moment we have not had a chance
to look into <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">other
open source licenses</a>.</p>

<p>There is concern that a license with GNU in it may put of some
potential backers of the project. In particular Microsoft's support
may be important as the provider of the most popular desktop
operating system. We need to find out if this will be an issue.
Releasing the code under the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> is irreversible, so
we need to be <em>very</em> sure before we do so. Otherwise the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> could be
appropriate for Dasher as a whole. It allows people to charge for
distribution and anyone to use it. In addition it guarantees
perpetual access to the source for all.</p>

<p>It is possible that the core of Dasher, made available as a
library, could carry different license terms to its graphical user
interface (GUI). We <em>believe</em> that the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> could also be
appropriate for an application that can embed itself into other
applications, for example using OLE under Windows, or Bonobo under
GNOME. However, we will consider the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a> for a core
library version of Dasher.</p>

<p>Since the meeting IAM has noted Free Software Foundation (FSF) advice to
include a sound copyright notice. Only the copyright holder of a work is able to
take action if the <a href= "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> is
violated. In fact the FSF insists that any contributions to its software are
donated to them and <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AssignCopyright">advises others do the
same</a> (The rest of the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">FAQ</a> is useful too). Also the <a
href= "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a>, although <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">not preferred by the
FSF</a>, may be appropriate if our aim is to ensure widespread use:</p>

<p><em>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
programs...<br>
...on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
de-facto standard.</em></p>

<h3>Ideas about a command-mode character (ESC)</h3>
<pre>
I have been thinking about dasher while reading a book about Open Source.

I suggest the following plan for "control while dashing"

1. Have an option to add an "ESC" character to the alphabet.
	a) in all contexts
	b) only in post-punctuation contexts

	Option b means that the ESC character has very near zero
	probability when the latest character is a..zA..Z
	or any other letter in that class. 

	In other contexts, the ESC character is given a probability
	at least pESCmin (eg 1/100), and possibly larger, depending
	on how strong the predns are in the current context. 
	If the lang model makes a strong prediction (eg it knows what
	word is coming next) then we don't want to spoil this
	predn by filling the screen with ESC. But in a bland
	context, maybe as much as 1/15 could be ESC.

2. Show the ESC character by a special colour box,
	located at the top of the alphabet before a.
	Note, this will solve the aaaa problem, perhaps.

3. Inside the ESC box, provide a set of equal probability boxes 
	emulating a menu of control options.
	If necessary have some options lead to sub options.
	Have the control options be identical to the optins
	available by clicking buttons off the dasher canvas.
	For crucial actions such as "close dasher", "new file",
	have a confirm dialog, "yes"/"no", all implemented
	by regular dashing dynamics. 
	For all appropriate menus, have the bottom item in the 
	list be an "abort command mode" option, coloured a special
	colour, which takes one back to writing in the 
	current context.
</pre>

<h3>Discussion of when text is committed to the text box</h3>
<pre>
djcm to djw:
 Iain was asking whether there is any particular reason for
 the distinction between the two boundaries in pocketPC dasher - 
 text that has fallen off the LHS goes into the text box when writing; 
 when not writing, text to the left of halfway goes in the text box.  I
am used to this and it doesn't bother me, but Iain was suggesting  an
alternate procedure of putting stuff in the text box when it has passed 
 halfway and corresponds to a box that contains the crosshair. 
 My guess is that your rationale was to only put stuff in the text box
when it 
 has been definitely committed. (except when the user stops writing)
This probably is a good rationale, since otherwise users will start to
fret 
 about thinking they have written something and trying to undo it when 
 in fact they simply clipped a big box on the way to their  intended
little box. 
 It might be helpful if you told us your thinking on this. 
 A possible problem with the LHS rule is that if the user wishes to 
 use a large left-hand context on screen (as can be done in 168 with the
log 
 controls) then there is a big delay before stuff goes to the text box.

djw to djcm:
I intended that version 2 should always display the text upto the
crosshair and not just dump it out when you lift the pen. See version
168 for the behaviour I prefer.

However, the LHS is significant for me because that's when I add
characters to the language model (also where I prune the data structure
but that's just implementation). If you add what ever appears under the
cross-hair to the LM then you end up feeding part-gibberish into it.

But my method of adding to the LM can also break if you are allowed to
zoom out or edit text. Removing stuff from the LM would be very tedious.
So there are some things to think about.

How Dasher would operate as a conventinal keyboard is not
straightforward. E.g. if you write 

rm -rf\n 

into your shell, when does it execute the command? What if I zoom out -
can I undo my command!!! 

David.

djcm to djw:
-------------
I would suggest this:
whenever there is a character which is the final character
in a command of some sort (eg \n in  rm *\n )
this character should contain within it a special coloured
sub-square, of size (say) 1/3, padded on either side by 
two alternate "abort" squares, so that the user is unlikely to 
accidentally pass the special "do it!" subsquare, which is central,
over the crosshair.

The "abort" squares could be functionless squares that just
act as padding, or they could have an appropriate function (equiv to C-C, say)

<h3>Thoughts on alphabetical order for punctuation</h3>
<h5>David MacKay</h5>
<pre>
Punctuation ideas.

I would like to suggest a minimal alphabet, a medium alphabet, and
 a full alphabet.
 The default would be the medium one.

(1)

MINIMAL = lower case only, and a tiny number of punc chars.
No numbers. Good for writing conversation, email. Similar to dasher 168.

   Space character always at end of list (displayed by underscore, by default,
   but the character used to show the space should be adjustable by the
   user, eventually).

(I won't show the space char in the any of the following)

	a..z'-?!,.

 
(2) a MEDIUM punctuation list.

	Let's build it up. Upper case included in the default. 

   a..zA..Z0123456789$'-?!,.

   or
   
   1234567890$'-?!,.

   probably the latter is more standard, cf keyboard. (zero location)

 - provide this punctuation set as standard in all languages.
 Other punctuation to be optional.....? Or maybe....

 (1a) Borderline punctuation chars that
      could have a strong case for being in the minimal standard list:

      /:@

      I'll leave this decision up to you. I think I would tend towards
      including them.

      Where to include these if you do include them:
      I don't have a strong opinion, but suggest this,
      which preserves a distinction between "ordinary writing" ( $'-:?!,. )
      and funny characters.

                 VV   V  
       1234567890/@$'-:?!,.

       However an argument for this order:

       1234567890/$@'-:?!,.

       is that $ is associated with numbers more than is @.
              
	Another borderline character is the NEWLINE character, represented by P
	here. I would put it here

	(since it is a lot like white space)

       1234567890/$@'-:?!,.P
	
 Note the grouping of all characters with status similar to full stop adjacent to
 the space char. - The chars "/$@" are not similar to full stop. The others are.

 The character "'" is not always like a full stop but you do tend
 to find it at the end of words.

	The characters ( and ) should perhaps be included in the
	minimal alphabet too.

	Where to put them?

	Either straight after a..zA..Z

       ()1234567890/$@'-:?!,.P

	or else adjacent to the quote mark, since it is a similar delimiter:

       1234567890/$@()'-:?!,.P

       Another candidate for the minimal alphabet is the POUND sign, <pound>
       or #, to be located next to the $. I will write it as # from now on.

       In conclusion this is the largest "medium" list I would go for.

              1234567890/#$@()'-:?!,.P


(2) Here is a suggestion for the whole punctuation list

What have we left out?

	stop-like characters:              ;

	quote-like:                        "`

	paren-like:                        []{}<>    (in your choice of order)

	strange characters, like @   |\~^_&          (in any order)

	characters associated with numbers, like / and $:
						%*+=      (in any order)

	any others?                        YEN, Euro.


	I would put these in the medium list along with their cousins.

	So it looks like this:

              1234567890%*+=/#$|\~^_&@[]{}<>()"`'-:;?!,.P

	      That's my best stab, feel free to modify it.

<li>	Idea 5:  include a button which brings up a separate window 
		that is huge and that contains all the text written so far, with a 
		scroll bar so you can look at it.
</ul>
	This button could be placed in the bottom row of the window, 
	in the bottom right hand corner. The words "Idle - press space bar
	to start Dasher" could be reduced to "Press space bar
        to start" and similarly "Press space bar to stop" (no Dasher running),
	so as to increase the spare space on the screen.

	I think Idea 5 should be very easy to implement. The extra window
	would have a "Dismiss" button to get rid of it.

 Provide an introductory training environment?
<li>  try dasher with a Headmouse.
<li> Clarify what happens to  Dasher's useful "learning" --
	on exit, offer the chance to APPEND the text
	to the default training file for use next time.
<br>
	We should clarify this in the readme, and say (for the present
	desktop version) that when you start Dasher, it will
	train itself on whatever is in .... ;
so you have two options if you want it to learn from session to session.
Either you have to APPEND what you have written to that input file;
(can we make a button to do that?!)
Or you can start Dasher and use the .... menu to get the "read more stuff"
dialog.
<br>
	Presumably the long term plan is to have the APPEND happen
	automatically as in the ipaq.  This will lead to problems
	however because (a) it will run out of space when used heavily;
	(b) when your neice plays with it and writes erweieiwuediwencwnwieujn
	it will never forget it.
<br>
	Need to think about this more.
	I think prompting the user, on exit "? append ?" is the best way.
	Or there could simply be two exit buttons - exit+append
	and exit+discard.
<li>
 The SAVE-to-File menu is awkward for severely disabled people.
	John had a good suggestion: the save-to-file should
	automatically propose a filename (eg file1, file2, file3, ...)
	so that the user can accept the proposal if they like it.
<li> Clarify what the effect of SAVE to FILE 
	would be.
	
	I think it would be a good idea for the save menu to 
	have options:  APPEND / WRITE .

<li>  would like his dasher writings to be AUTOSAVED
	to a sensible filename every 30 seconds.

<li> Provide "how fast you are writing" information
	in a pop-uppable window?

<li> Provide a way for disatisfaction with corpus to get back to
	us.
	(1) Any particular words or phrases that were
	unreasonably difficult on a first occasion?
	Any words that SHOULD be easy that are not?
	(2)  Are there any cases where the model is bad
	and even though the user writes for a long time,
	the model is still bad?
	
<li>
	Maybe we should try to make 3 or 4 corpuses in different
	styles (Legal/Student/Yoof culture/Pompous novels)
	and allow the beginning user to use checkboxes to select
	which they want. 
	On the other hand, maybe we should just start with a good
	broad corpus and make sure that the thing does a good
	job of learning and STORING what it has learned and retrieving it	
	next time.
<li>
	order:	a..z'-,._

I have a minor suggestion for the main tcl window.

The text that says "dasher running" etc

- not only could it be shrunk abit,
but another good thing would be to declare the size 
of this object.

At present, if the user wishes to shrink dasher down to
take up less screen real estate, they can shrink the 
canvas, but then the resulting 
dasher window jumps about in size because the text box
(which limits the smallest size possible)
is changing in size. "The text box" here meaning the 
box that contains the words "Dasher running" .

I think it would be good to fix the size of the object
so that the dasher window has a constant size independent
of what that text does.

Similarly the "initials" object, I think should have a fixed size of
five characters, and the "no initials entered" string can 
be replaced by "---".

These changes will reduce the amount of text in the window,
which is a good thing.
