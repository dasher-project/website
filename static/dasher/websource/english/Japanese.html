 <h2><img align=middle src="/dasher/images/daishoyaK2.gif" alt="daishoya" width="53" height="20"> - JDasher - Japanese Dasher - DAISHOYA</h2>

 <p>
	The Japanese name for Dasher is
	Daishoya (<img align=middle border=0 src="/dasher/images/daishoyaH2.gif" alt="daishoya" width="86" height="17">),
	 which means `scribe'.

 </p>
 <p>
 Dasher can be used to write Japanese in
 several different ways.

 <h4>Hiragana alphabets</h4>
 <p>  We replace the English alphabet
  a..z by the Hiragana alphabet, <img src="/dasher/images/aiueo.gif" alt="aiueo..." width="235" height="18">
  (a,i,u,e,o, ka,ki,ku,ke,ko,...); and
   we replace the English training text by a Hiragana document. [Unfortunately,
  we have not been able to find a large pure-Hiragana  document, so
  our language model is not as well-trained as we would like.]
 </p><p> 
 Two orderings of the Hiragana alphabet are available.
 In "Hiragana 60" the diacritical marks (",o) are
 included as separate characters; in "Hiragana 83" they are integrated
 by including the characters <img align=middle src="/dasher/images/paba.gif" alt="pa,ba" width="48" height="20">, etc.  in the  alphabet ("pa", "ba").

<p>
 <a href=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/kaburagi/scripts/>Here are scripts written by Kaburagi</a>
 for converting Japanese to `Furigana' (mixed hiragana/kanji, with each kanji accompanied by
 its kana pronunciation).
 </p>
<h3>Full Japanese Dasher</h3>
 <p>
  The full Japanese version, written by T. Kaburagi,   works like this:
 the user  writes each phrase in Hiragana; then if she wants
 to convert the word to Kanji, she enters a special control character "&gt;" (within Dasher)
 and Dasher offers the alternative Kanji sequences for the given Hiragana sequence,
 with the space devoted to each Kanji determined by a language model;
 the user selects the desired Kanji sequence within Dasher, then writes the next kana sequence.
