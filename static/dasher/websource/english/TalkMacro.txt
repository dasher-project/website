 Macro to make Dasher "talk"
 From: Margaret Cotts

I put together a macro to enable Dasher 1.6.8 to 'talk out loud'. (It's not
totally perfect- it takes 4-5 seconds after you type something in Dasher
for it to talk out loud. However, when a version of Dasher comes out
which will allow you to copy and paste the text from the Dasher window,
it will be possible to make the macro shorter (and faster).
 
If you don't need Dasher for communication, you can still use macros to
perform other activities. For example, you could type a 2 letter code on
your keyboard (or your on-screen keyboard), and it would instantly take
what you have written in Dasher, and paste in into Microsoft Word, or an
e-mail program.
 
I used a program called Macro Express to write this particular macro. I
highly recommend it for anyone who has a physical disability, or for
anyone who just wants to be more efficient on the computer.
 
For people not familiar with the term, a macro is a sequence of commands
that allow you to perform a specific task. There are certain tasks which
might take several steps. With a macro, you can hit 2 or 3 keys, and it
will quickly execute all the steps.
 
In order to use Dasher to talk out loud, you will need 3-4 pieces of
software (which you can download off the internet.)
 
1.	Dasher (free)
2.	E-triloquist (free communication  program)
		http://www.etriloquist.com/
3.	Macro Express ($40.00) (You can download a demo which will work
		for 30 days.) www.macros.com <http://www.macros.com/> 
4.	Click-N-Type (free) (optional) This is a free on-screen
		keyboard. You will need this if you can't use the keyboard.

Step 1- Download all of the above software programs. It would be
worthwhile to take the Macro Express tutorial, to get a sense of how it
works, before you try to make this macro. (This e-mail doesn't explain
how to use Macro Express- rather, it just explains what the finished
macro is going to look like.)
 
Step 2- Go into Dasher, create a document, save this document as "1" (no
 quotes)
 
Step 3- In Macro Express, go into Options/Preferences/Shortkeys/Use
Prefix Keys.  For our prefix key, we are going to use a comma.

Note: I wrote this macro specifically for my computer. Because of the
nature of this macro, it's not possible to just copy and paste it- you
need to have a sense of why each step exists, in order to personalize it
for your computer. 
 
Here is the what the finished macro is going to look like, step by step.
Below is an explanation of the rationale for each step.  
 
1.	Activate or Launch: "Dasher" OR "dasher.exe"
(This makes sure that Dasher is the active program.)


2.	Text Type: <F4>
(If you are inside Dasher, and you click on "File", F4 is the command
which lets you bring up the "Save As" Window)


3.	Wait for Window Title: "Save As"
(Timing is crucial with Macro Express. Basically, this step is saying,
"wait until the window appears before you do anything else.)


4.	Text Type: 1 <ENTER> Y
(What's basically just happened is that you are titling your new
document with the title "1". When you hit the ENTER key, that's just
like clicking on the highlighted "Save" Button.) However, you have
ALREADY created a document entitled "1". So, a window will appear and
say " /   /Dasher Docs 1 already exists. Do you want to replace the
existing document?". Typing the "Y" is the same as typing "yes".

IN STEPS 1-4, YOU ARE SAVING THE TEXT YOU HAVE CREATED IN DASHER. YOU
HAVE SAVED IT WITH THE TITLE "1"


5.	Open Folder: C:Windows\Desktop\Dasher\Dasherdocs
(Note: I happen to keep my Dasher documents on my desktop. You will need
to open the folder Dasher Docs wherever it exists on your computer.)


6.	Wait for Window Title: "Dasher Docs"


7.	Text Type : 1<ENTER>
(Typing "1" selects the document titled 1. (If you had an item title
"George", and you type a "G", it will take you to the first document
titled with a "G". Hitting the "G" again will take you to other items
beginning with the letter "G".)  Typing the Enter Key then opens the
document up.

IN STEPS 5-8, YOU ARE GOING INTO THE FOLDER WHERE YOU KEEP ALL YOUR
DASHER DOCUMENTS. YOU ARE OPENING THE DOCUMENT YOU HAVE JUST CREATED
CALLED "1".


8.	Wait for Window Title: "Open With"
(A window is going to pop up, asking, "Open With". It wants to know what
program you are going to use to open the "1" Document that you have
created using Dasher.)


9.    Text Type w <ARROW DOWN><ARROW DOWN><ARROW DOWN> <ENTER>
       (We are trying to open up the document entitled "1" with WordPad.
I happen to have 3 programs on my computer that start with the letter
"W". You may have more or less programs that start with the letter "W".
Basically, I typed the letter "w", and arrowed down until Word Pad was
highlighted.


10.  Wait for Window Title: "1"
       (We are waiting for the window with the title "1" to appear)


11.  Wait time elapse: 0 Minutes 1 Seconds 
       (Maybe there was a reason I had this step here- if so, it's
eluding me right now. You might not need step 11.)


12.   Text Type <CONTROL> a
        (Typing Ctrl A selects all the text in Word Pad)


13.   Text Type <CONTROL> c
         (Typing Ctrl C copies all of the text in our WordPad document.)


IN STEPS 8-13, YOU ARE OPENING THE DASHER DOCUMENT TITLED "1" WITH
WORDPAD. YOU ARE SELECTING ALL THE TEXT INSIDE THIS WORDPAD DOCUMENT,
AND COPYING IT. 
 
14.  Window Close "1- Word Pad"
       (We have to close this document, in order to be able to use it
for "talking" again. Just trust me on this one :-) 


15.   Window Close: "Dasher Docs"
      (We have to close the folder for our Dasher documents. If we don't
close it, our macro won't work the next time we want to talk out loud.)


16.  Activate or Launch "e-trilo" OR "ETRILO~1.Ink"
      (We want to make sure that Etriloquist is the active program.)


17.  Wait for Window title "e-trilo"


18.   Text Type: <CONTROL>v<ALT>s<ENTER>
        <CONTROL>v  pastes the text from Word Pad into Etriloquist
        <ALT>s is the command in Etriloquist for speaking out loud.
 
IN STEPS 14 THROUGH 18, WE ARE CLOSING OUR WORDPAD DOCUMENT, AND OUR
FOLDER OF DASHER DOCUMENTS, SO IT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO USE THE NEXT TIME
WE WANT TO USE OUR MACRO. WE ARE PUTTING THE FOCUS ON THE ETRILOQUIST
PROGRAM. WE ARE PASTING THE TEXT FROM OUR DOCUMENT ENTITLED "1" INTO OUR
ETRILOQUIST MAIN SPEAKING MENU. THEN WE ARE TALKING IT OUT LOUD.
         
Note: For my macro, I used something called a "shortkey" macro. This
means that my macro is activated by a little "code" I have created. The
code I arbitrarily chose was called  "tn" (without the quotes.) It
stands for "Talk Now".
 
My prefix key is a comma. That means that in order for my macro to work,
I have to type a comma, then immediately follow it with the letters "tn"
(Thanks to A. Cantor for suggesting the use of a comma as a prefix key.)
 
In order for this Macro to work efficiently, you will have to have a way
to quickly get back to Dasher. Create a little macro which will put the
focus back onto Dasher. When I type a comma, then D, I instantly go back
to Dasher.
 
So, the beauty of a macro is that when you type (comma)tn, in three
short keystrokes, it will quickly perform all of the above actions.
 
There are a few things you have to do to make sure this macro works
properly:
 
To use the Macro, (once you have created it.)
 
1.	Open up your Etriloquist program. Click in the Main Speaking
Window to activate it. (This is a very important step- you have to make
sure Etriloquist is open.)
2.	Go into Dasher and type the text that you want to speak out
loud.
3.	Type ,tn 

You can type the above keystrokes either using your keyboard or your
on-screen keyboard (Click-N-Type)


4.	The text you created in Dasher will be spoken in Etriloquist.
5.	Type your macro to get back to Dasher.


A WORD ABOUT ETRILOQUIST AND MACRO EXPRESS.


Now that you have Macro Express on your computer, you can use it to
create "abbreviation expansions" in Etriloquist. 
So you can write a 2 letter code which expands out into a longer text.
(For example, I can put a macro into Macro Express which states,
'Everytime I type BP, I want it to expand out and say "Please be patient
while I type my message."'

Then, we I go to Etriloquist, and I type (comma)bp, it will type out
"Please be patient while I type my message.")
 
Enjoy!

I concocted a combination using Key2Speak (similar to E-Triloquist,
Read Please, etc.) and MS Excel. The Key2Speak software (look it up
for a free 30-day trial - http://www.key2speak.com) verbalizes
anything in the clipboard. So if you store a word (or a phrase) in an
Excel spreadsheet cell and then Control-C that cell, Excel stores it
in the clipboard, and Key2Speak immediately speaks the word.
