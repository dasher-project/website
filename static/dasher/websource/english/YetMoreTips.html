<b>What do the colours mean?</b><br>
	In the English-language desktop version 3 of
	 Dasher,
<ul>
  <li> <b>white</b> squares  contain the
	  space characters (always placed
 at the bottom of the alphabet);
       </li><li>
 a special <b>yellow</b> box contains the upper case characters [A-Z];
       </li><li>
 a  <b>red</b> box contains numerals [0-9] (if the full alphabet is enabled);
       </li><li>
 a  <b>green</b> box contains punctuation characters (with the
	    characters most similar to the space character
	    [.,;:-]
	    placed at the bottom, next to the <b>white</b> space character.
       </li><li>
 the other colours are included simply to discriminate
	  the squares from each other.
	    </li></ul>
	  <br>
	  In other languages, colours may have additional meanings:
	    for example in  Japanese,  colours
	    are used to distinguish the different hiragana
	    groups (eg ka,ki,ku,ke,ko are orange).

  <h4>How to start dasher (version 3)</h4>
<p>  Set the dasher application
	running; when the dasher window comes up, either click the left mouse button
	or press the space bar to set it going. [One of these two will work.]
	Repeat this action (click or space), when you are finished, to stop dasher from dashing.
	Your computer's mouse controls Dasher.

   Adjust the speed slider to fix the maximum speed Dasher will zoom at.
  A speed of 1 is good for a beginner; increasing to  2 after 5 minutes' practice, and to 4 when
  you are expert.
