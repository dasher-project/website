HiddenPage Version 3.2
<h2>Version 3.2 new features</h2>
 The key new features of Dasher 3.2.0
are:
<ol>
  <li>One-dimensional mode; start on mouse-position - making it possible
        for someone who can only move one muscle to write with Dasher
        and stop and start Dasher themselves.
       </li>
  <li>Control mode - giving rudimentary stop, pause, edit, and speech options.
       </li>
  <li>Alphabet + colour options - many new alphabets to choose from,
        plus the option to define your own colour schemes.
       </li>
  <li>Speech is available in both Windows and Linux.
       </li>
  <li>Language model has a new user-adjustable parameter, which controls
       how much real-estate is devoted to predicting characters that are
       not predicted by the language model proper. (Default 5%, but
       beginners, or people writing bizarre documents, might like to increase this.)
       </li>
  <li>
       </li>
</ol>

<h2>Version 3.2 information for Developers</h2>
<h2>Making version 3.2 under Debian</h2>


From a fresh CVS checkout, you need to do ./autogen.sh in order to
generate the configure scripts and makefiles, and then make. Eigg is
probably the best machine to do this on - the libraries required for
building Dasher aren't on all of the systems yet.
