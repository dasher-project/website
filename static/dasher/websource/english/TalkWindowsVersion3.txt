    Making Dasher 'talk on stop'

I've been testing Dasher for a few days with different speech 
programs.  When I downloaded version 3.0 I realized it had copy on 
stop.  I remembered Readplease plus had the option to automatically 
read anything copied to the clipboard, effectively giving 
Dasher 'talk on stop.' If you have Readplease plus that works.  
(I don't have the plus version, too expensive for my taste) With that 
in mind I searched for a free program that simply reads from the 
clipboard on copy.  Here's what I came up with; 

Talking clipboard; automatically reads anything copied to the 
clipboard using Microsoft Agent.  No frills, no extras.  Freeware.  

Talking box pro; automatically reads anything copied to the clipboard 
using Microsoft Agent. Same as above with more features, calendar, 
talking clock, more controls.  (Beta freeware) both are on this 
page.  (if you don't have Microsoft Agent installed you can get it 
here)

Speak lite; automatically reads anything copied to the clipboard 
using Microsoft Agent. Very similar to talking box pro, calendar, 
talking clock, more controls.  Microsoft Agent included.   (shareware 
fully functional with nag reminder to register)  cheap though $13.99

I did find a few more but wasn't happy with the trial versions.  If 
anyone knows of a simple freeware program that just sends copied text 
automatically from the clipboard to a speech engine please let me 
know.  Maybe someone can write a simple control similar to talking 
clipboard and share it?  

Until then you can get Dasher talking on stop with no delay by using 
these.  By the way, for those in the ALS group if you use 'Chip's 
speaking' you already have Microsoft Agent installed.  

Take care
