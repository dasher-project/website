 Many languages are supported in Dasher version 3,
 and new languages can be enabled by adding an appropriate
 alphabet.xml file. As of November 2005, the only major languages that
 are <em>not</em> supported in Dasher version 3 are Japanese and Chinese; for these
 two languages we have partial solutions in version 3, and we intend to have complete
 solutions in version 4.
</p><p>
 We encourage you to <b>personalize</b> Dasher by supplying a <b>training file</b>
 written in your own style.

<h3>Instructions for Dasher versions 3 and 4</h3>
 <p>
         With version 3, as with version 1.6, every language  requires a
 text file full of natural writing (about 300K or more); a specification of
 the alphabet of the language is also required.
 Version 3  works in Unicode.
 Many languages are supported in Dasher version 3.
