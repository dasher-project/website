 Research Associate / Software Developer, Cavendish Laboratory

 A post is available immediately for a research associate to work as
 lead software developer in the Dasher research project
 (www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/) at the Department of Physics.
 The post is available immediately and

 Wednesday 23rd October. The successful applicant will have C++,
 linux, and windows skills, and at least one degree in 
 Science, Maths, or Engineering.  Salary will depend on

 Dasher is free software that enables people, who can't use
 keyboards, to write. 

 Skills required of the research associate include: outstanding C++
 programming; and experience in the maintenance of multi-platform
 software packages.
 
 The research associate will have responsibility for
 project management, including
 
  o  Coordinating the efforts of the free software volunteers,
	as new features are added. Incorporating and,
	where necessary, rewriting their contributions.
  o  Ensuring cross-platform consistency.
  o  Maintaining an authoritative version of the software
	and set of executables.
  o  Maintaining consistent documentation, including
	translations.
  o  Coordinating Bug-fixing.
  o  Ensuring Dasher works in all supported languages,
	and increasing the number of languages supported.
  o  Interacting with the ACE programme (www.ace-centre.org.uk).

 Some of these responsibilities may naturally be devolved to
 free software volunteers.	

 The research associate will also play an active role in advancing the
 research of the Dasher project, including (1) investigating
 enhancements to the eyetracking version of Dasher; (2) making a
 version of Dasher for disabled people who can only convey one degree
 of freedom (one-dimensional pointing) rather than two.  Aspects of
 Dasher that are important to disabled users and that are not being
 addressed by the free software volunteers will be a special focus of
 the research associate's programming efforts.
