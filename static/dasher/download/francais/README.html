When I view the corpus using more, I get the impression that 
two different characters have been used for the apostrophe (').
One of them does not render correctly under more.

 corpus2.zip  contains corpus2.txt derived from   MetroFR.TXT  which was supplied by    Peter Baert <pbaert@rug.be>
 It's Newspaper articles.

The document contains a lot of URLs (without http:// prefix). It might be good to strip these out
if the corpus is to be used for conversational French. Indeed, that's what's in corpus2.txt
perl -pe 's/^www\..*\n//'   MetroFR.TXT   > corpus2.txt
perl -pi.bak -e 's/^http:\/\/.*\n//'   corpus2.txt
