See the head of the colour.euroasian.xml file
for an explanation of the colours in Dasher.

/home/ftp/pub/www/dasher/download/alphabets

In this public directory, most of the alphabet files are intended
for public distribution with the dasher executable.

Exceptions are

 alphabet.Joyo.xml
 alphabet.Japanese.xml
 alphabet.arabicCRASH.xml
 alphabet.test.xml
 alphabet.bliss.xml
 alphabet-kanji-stroke.xml

We need to add to this directory Kaburagi's new Japanese alphabet file,
and the finalized Chinese alphabet file (expected Aug 2005).
At that point we can perhaps remove some of the current chinese alphabet files.

Of the colour files, all of these may be shipped

 colour.jamie.xml
 colour.rainbow.xml
 colour.blue.xml
 colour.vowels.xml
 colour.vowels2.xml
 colour.xml
 colour.euroasian.xml

and I suggest that we STOP shipping Hiragana colour file [ 
 colour.hiragana.xml
] because it is superceded by euroasian.

We should also ship these xsl files:

 alphabet-nest.xsl  alphabet-nest2.xsl  alphabet.xsl  colour.xsl
