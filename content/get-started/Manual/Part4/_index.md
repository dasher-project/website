## 4 Languages

Dasher works in hundreds of languages.

For each language there is an alphabet file (or possibly more than one alphabet file). On the Dasher website we aim to supply at least one training text for each language. If we donâ€™t have a good training text for your language, please help us by making one and sending it to us.

See the Dasher website for the list of languages supported by Dasher. As of October 2005, all the major languages of the world are well supported, with the exception of Japanese and Chinese, for which Dasher version 3 offers only phonetic support (hiragana and pin-yin). In Dasher version 4, we will provide full support for Japanese and Chinese.

[More issues to discuss here: how combining accents work; fonts. Scripts to convert to composed or decomposed form.]
