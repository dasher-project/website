## Dasher Special Needs Guide

### David J.C. MacKay

**January 25, 2006**

Dasher can be driven in many ways. This guide helps you find which versions of
Dasher are most efficient for you.

*As of April 2005, the newest versions of Dasher mentioned here are implemented on
the Linux platform only. We aim to have them all implemented on all platforms by
September 2005.*

Dasher is designed on the principle of getting *as much information as possible* from the
gestures you can make.
We can get information from whichever of the following is easiest for you:

1. *Continuous* gestures (conveyed via a joystick, trackpad, head mouse, or gaze tracker, for
    example) often achieve the highest rates of writing.
2. *Discrete* gestures (switches, button presses) may be able to convey information in three
    different ways:

```
(a) The time at which you press a button can convey information. (This idea is used in
grid systems controlled by a single button.)
(b) How long you press a button for can convey information. (This idea is used in Morse
code, where two durations are distinguished.)
(c) The choice of which button you press can convey information. (This idea is used in
ordinary keyboards.)
```
