Most of the original research work on Dasher was done by **David Ward**.

Between 1999 and 2002, we made three assessments of Dasher, comparing it with alternative text entry systems on three platforms.

*   One-handed text-entry using mouse alone
*   Text-entry on a pocket PC with a stylus
*   Text-entry with **no** hands, using Dasher with an Eyetracker ([Further information about hardware](SpecialNeeds.html))

The details can be found in David Ward's [PhD thesis](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/djw30/papers/thesis.html) and in the publications listed below.
