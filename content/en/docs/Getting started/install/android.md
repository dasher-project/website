Available from the Android Market (search for "Dasher") or from the [Downloads page](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Download.html)

Tested on Nexus One; HTC G1; HTC Incredible.

Works as system input method, i.e. select any text field to activate. Cursor movement (via trackball) should cause Dasher to automatically update its display. (Unless the trackball is being used to control Dasher in Compass Mode!)

Supported control modes:

*   Touch - tap to zoom to a point or hold to move steadily;
*   Tilt in one or two dimensions, either tap (/circle) to start/stop or hold finger to go;
*   Box modes (scanning/direct)
*   Compass mode (move trackball up/down to scroll, right to zoom in, left to back up)
*   Two-button dynamic mode (by volume control, or tap top/bottom of screen)
*   One-button dynamic mode (aka two-push - use any key, or tap anywhere on screen)

Button modes can also be controlled by external switches connected via Bluetooth using the [Tekla](http://scyp.idrc.ocad.ca/projects/tekla) external switch.

#### Installation

Video forthcoming...

(1) Download from [Dasher website](http://inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/Dasher/downloads/) or search for "Dasher" on the Android Market

(2) Running Dasher will present a blank screen (titled Dasher) while Dasher loads (please wait). You'll then be presented with Dasher's own settings.

The "Input Mode" page offers a choice of methods, e.g. "Touch Control" or "Tilt Control", of which you may pick one. (Each will bring up further settings specific to that mode.)
