Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example:

* On a palmtop computer
* on a wearable computer
* when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse
* when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker)

The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write text as fast as normal handwriting - 29 words per minute; using a mouse, experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.

Dasher can be used to write efficiently in any language.

Dasher is fast and fun to learn.

Dasher is free software. It's distributed under the same license as GNU/Linux, the GPL.
