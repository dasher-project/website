So a group of us have been working on Dasher v6 for a little while now - and we figured its about time to get something out there publicly about the inner workings of the project - so you can help out or just find out where this is all up to. 

The site has a little history. Back in early 2019 I was trying to update the documentation for a number of end users and we attempted to move all the documentation from the inference groups site (there is a lot of it) - to a new markdown format. We did it but I then shelved the project  - as moving the docs was one thing but they all needed a little more sprucing up. 

Skip forward some time and the development group were feeling that it was time for a public presence to share our news and updates - but also get other peoples input. We decided to strip out the docs for now and focus this site purely on the new version 6 build. 

The site is using [docsy](http://docsy.dev) - a fab Google product using hugo as a static site generator for documentation. There are other Static site generators (e.g. VuePress) but for this task Docsy seemed like a good fit. 

Now I'm no UX expert. If you have any suggestions let me know and I'll do what I can! 

Hopefully the team can input there own thoughts and discussions when they get the chance. Otherwise I'll try and keep it all updated as we can.
