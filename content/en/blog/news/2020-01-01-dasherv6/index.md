## History

Dasher started life in the form of a prototype written in 1997 by David MacKay, who at the time was a lecturer in physics at the University of Cambridge. David had been discussing the then current generation of mobile devices with a colleague, and felt that the use of physical keyboards for text entry made them unnecessarily bulky. Dasher was inspired by 'arithmetic coding', an efficient file compression technique which was one of the subjects taught by David in his popular fourth year course for undergraduates.

Between 1998 and 2002, one of David MacKay’s PhD students, David Ward, developed Dasher into a fully featured open source application for Windows and Linux as part of his work towards his thesis. Over the years, many other people worked on Dasher, many of whom were in David’s research group, the Inference Group. The software was ported to a number of platforms, including Apple macOS and iOS as well as few which are now less relevant, such as Solaris and various pre-iPhone mobile devices. Dasher became part of the GNOME Desktop project in 2002, which resulted in the software being included in several Linux distributions.

Dasher was conceived as a flexible text entry system. As well as the core applications in AAC and mobile devices, it was designed to be portable and has been used on a number of more specialised hardware platforms, such as wearable computers. Dasher has also been used for text entry in languages with large alphabets, such as Chinese and Japanese.

Dasher was developed to work as a standalone tool, but was also integrated into assistive text entry frameworks on Linux and Windows, which allowed it to be used to enter text into other applications. Since early versions, Dasher has included speech synthesis software to allow it to function as a communication aid.

As well as conventional pointing devices such as mouses, Dasher has been evaluated with eye trackers, joysticks, and discrete buttons, all in various configurations. A number of research papers have been published comparing the effectiveness and efficiency of these input mechanisms.

The original Dasher project was largely dormant after version 4.11, which was released in March 2010. In 2016 the Dasher project was restarted, and version 5 was developed. In 2019 the current project to create version 6, which is a complete rebuild using a more modern technology base, was kicked off.

*   Define single a `GameServer`, or large pre-spun game server `Fleets`, either through kubectl + yaml or via the 
    Kubernetes API.
*   Manage GameServer life cycles - including health checking and connection information through configuration and an
    integrated SDK.
*   Game server `Fleet` autoscaling capabilities that integrate with Kubernetes' native cluster autoscaling.
*   Game server specific metric exports and dashboards for operations teams.
*   Allocate `GameServers` out of a set for players to play on, even while scaling or updating backing Fleet
    configuration and rollout.
*   Optimisation patterns for both Cloud and On-Premises to ensure cost effective usage of your infrastructure.
*   Modular architecture that can be further customised to the needs of your game.
*   Local development tools for fast development interaction without the need of a full Kubernetes cluster.

A massive thanks to everyone in the  community - from our users, to people that have submitted bugs and feature
requests, to contributors, approvers and more. This has truly been a group effort, and it wouldn’t have been
possible without the time and effort that many people have put into this project.
